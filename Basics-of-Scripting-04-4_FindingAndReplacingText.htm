<h1>4.4 Finding and Replacing Text</h1>

<p>Like any text editor, you can find specific strings of text. You can also
search for and replace specific strings of text.</p>

<h2>Finding Specific Text</h2>

<p>To find specific strings of text choose Find&#8230;from the Edit menu or
press<b> CTRL+F</b> to display the Find dialog. When the Script Manager
displays the Find dialog, the Find What edit box is
active. Type the desired text and press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Match Whole
Word only check box. By default, this check box is unchecked. Press <b>SPACEBAR</b>
to check this check box and search for text that matches the entire search
string of text.<br>
You can then press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Match Case check box. This check
box is unchecked by default. Press <b>SPACEBAR</b> to check this check box and
cause the search to be case sensitive. Press <strong>TAB</strong> to move to the Direction set
of radio buttons. By default, the Down radio button is selected.
Use your arrow keys to change this option.</p>

<p>After you have entered your text and chosen the desired search options,
press <b>ENTER</b> to activate the Find Next button. The Script Manager moves
the insertion point to the first occurrence of the text. If the text is not
found, then the Script Manager plays an appropriate Windows error sound. This
Windows sound indicates the string of text was not found.</p>

<p>To find the next occurrence of text, select the Find Next option from the
Edit menu or press <b>F3</b>. The Find Next action moves the insertion point to
the next occurrence of text within the script file. You can continue to press <b>F3</b>
to move through the file until you reach the end of the file. At that point,
you will hear a Windows error sound advising you that the search string was not
found.</p>

<p>To find the prior string of text, choose the Prior Text option from the Edit
menu or press <b>SHIFT+F3</b>. The Prior Text action moves the insertion point
to the prior string of text within the script file. You can continue to press <b>SHIFT+F3</b>
to move to the prior string of text until you hear a warning sound. This
warning sound indicates you have reached the top of the file and the search
string was not found.</p>

<h2>Incremental Searches</h2>

<p>You can use incremental searches to find a specific string of text. An
incremental search is very similar to selecting an option in a combo box or
list box. To initiate the incremental search choose Incremental Search from the
Edit menu or press <b>ALT+CTRL+I</b>.</p>

<p>After you have initiated the search, start the search by typing one
character at a time. As you type, the Script Manager matches the characters you
have just typed with the corresponding word within the script file. For
example, you want to search for the SayMessage function. First, initiate the incremental search. Next, start typing SayMessage until a match is found.</p>

<p>After the search has matched the first occurrence of the string of
characters you have typed, press <b>F3</b> to find the next occurrence of text
or <b>SHIFT+F3</b> to find the prior occurrence of text.</p>

<p class="Note"><b>Note: </b>To start editing after
the incremental search finds the first string of text, press any of the
navigation keys to remove the highlight. If you do not remove the highlight
before you start editing, the Script Manager interprets your keystrokes as
additions to the incremental search. You can also view the text you have typed
in the status line at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<h2>Replacing Text</h2>

<p>Like most text editors and word processors, you can find a specific string
of text and replace it with another string of text. Choose the Replace option
from the Edit menu or press <b>CTRL+H </b>to display the Replace dialog. When
the Script Manager displays the Replace dialog, the Find What
edit box is active. Type the string of text you want to find in this edit box.
Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Replace With edit box and type the text you
would like to use as a replacement. Press <b>TAB</b> after you have entered the
replacement text to move to the Match Whole Word only check box. By default,
this check box is unchecked. Press <b>SPACEBAR</b> to check this check box and
force the replace text action to only replace text that matches the entire
search string.</p>

<p>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Match Case check box. This check box is
unchecked by default. Press <b>SPACEBAR</b> to check this check box and cause
the replace text action to be case sensitive.<br>
A series of command buttons follows the Match Case check box. You can find the
next occurrence of text, replace the first occurrence of text, or replace all
occurrences of text. Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the appropriate button. Press
the <b>SPACEBAR</b> to activate the button and carry out the replace text
action.</p>

<p>After the Script Manager finishes the find and replace action, you may hear a
Windows system sound. This sound indicates the find and replace action is
complete. Press <b>ESCAPE</b> to close the Replace dialog and return to the
Script Manager.</p>
