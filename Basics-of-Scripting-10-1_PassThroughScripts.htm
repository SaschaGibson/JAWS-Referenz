<h1>10.1 Pass-Through Scripts</h1>

<p>When you create a pass-through script, you must make certain to pass the
keystroke through to the application. It is important to remember that JAWS
determines what script to process each time you press a keystroke. If the
application keystroke is now attached to a script, then JAWS performs the
script first. If you do not pass the keystroke through within the script, then
the keystroke never activates the intended action and functionality of the
keystroke is lost.</p>

<h2>Creating the Script</h2>

<p>You can use the built-in function, TypeKey, to
pass the keystroke through to the active application once you have enhanced its
functionality in your script. The TypeKey function
requires a single parameter to complete its task. This parameter is a string of
text and can be enclosed in quotation marks, stored in a string variable or a
string constant. The keystroke can be anything from a single character such as
the letter <strong>S</strong> to a keystroke that opens a menu such as <strong>ALT+F</strong>.
You call the TypeKey function using the following syntax:</p>

<p class="Code">TypeKey ("Alt+F")</p>

<p>The above example shows the parameter being passed to the function as a
quoted string of text. An alternative way of passing the parameter is to store
the keystroke in a local variable you have declared in the script. The
following code example declares a local variable, stores the keystroke and then
uses the variable as a parameter for the TypeKey
function:</p>

<p class="Code">Var<br>
String sKeystroke<br>
Let sKeystroke = "ALT+F"<br>
TypeKey (sKeystroke)</p>

<p>You can also declare all of your keystrokes in a JAWS script header file. To
declare a keystroke constant for <strong>ALT+F</strong>,
type the following two statements in a JAWS script header file:</p>

<p class="Code">Const<br>
KSFileMenu= "Alt+F"</p>

<p>In the above constant declaration, the &#8220;KS&#8221; indicates it is a
constant containing a keystroke. </p>

<p>You can review a number of more commonly used keystroke constants by viewing
the Common.jsm JAWS script message file within the Script Manager. You will
find constant definitions for most of the more common keystrokes such as <strong>SPACEBAR</strong>, <strong>CTRL+PAGE UP</strong> and <strong>CTRL+PAGE DOWN</strong> in the
file.</p>

<p>The following code example illustrates the use of a constant as the
parameter for the TypeKey function:</p>

<p class="Code">TypeKey (KSFileMenu)</p>
