 <H1>11.1 Checking the Virtual Viewer Status</H1>
 
<P>Before you display text in the virtual viewer, you should check to make sure 
  it is not currently being displayed by another script or function. When you 
  find the virtual viewer is being displayed, you should deactivate it. Deactivating 
  the virtual viewer before you display new information prevents the text from 
  running together.</P>
<P> You use the built-in function, UserBufferIsActive, to check the status of 
  the virtual viewer. The function returns a value of 1 when the virtual viewer 
  is active or displayed and a value of 0 when the viewer is not displayed. You 
  can substitute the constant, TRUE, for the value of 1 and the constant, FALSE, 
  for the value of zero in your scripts.</P>
<P> When the virtual viewer is active, you use the built-in function, UserBufferDeactivate, 
  to close the virtual viewer. This function closes the virtual viewer just as 
  if you pressed <strong>ESC</strong> from the keyboard. You should place both 
  the UserBufferIsActive and the UserBufferDeactivate functions within a conditional 
  statement before you display the virtual viewer. An example of the use of both 
  functions follows:</P>
<P class="Code"> If UserBufferIsActive () Then<br>
UserBufferDeactivate () ; close the virtual viewer <br>
EndIf</p>
