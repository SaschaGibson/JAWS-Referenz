# Custom Label Functions

JAWS allows you to create a custom label for the current control. These
labels are stored in an ini-style file.

The functions in this section are used with the ini file where custom
labels are stored. The script file, ph.JSS, contains more functions you
can use to manage custom labels.

For a complete listing of Custom Label scripts and functions, see the
topics in this category book of the Reference Guide.
