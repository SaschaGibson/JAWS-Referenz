 <H1>10.0 Passing Keystrokes and Typing Text with Scripts</H1>
 
<P>People new to writing scripts with JAWS often find it hard to differentiate 
  between JAWS and Windows keystrokes. For example, the script writers at Freedom 
  Scientific have attached scripts to common Windows keystrokes such as <strong>CTRL+C</strong> 
  and<strong> CTRL+V</strong>, copy and paste. When you press either keystroke, 
  Windows still copies and pastes using these keystrokes. However, something else 
  also happens; when you press <strong>CTRL+C</strong> JAWS speaks &quot;copied 
  selection to clipboard.&quot; Likewise, when you press<strong> CTRL+V</strong>, 
  JAWS says, &quot;Pasted from clipboard.&quot; These messages 
  let you know the expected action has taken place. </P>
<P>The scripts associated with these keystrokes are examples of &quot;pass-through&quot; 
  scripts. It is called a pass-through script because JAWS intercepts the keystroke 
  before it reaches the application and performs the associated script. The script 
  adds some type of extra functionality to the keystroke and then passes the keystroke 
  through to the application. In this case the added functionality is the message 
  JAWS speaks to notify you the action has been completed. </P>
<P>In this chapter, you will learn how to capture keystrokes, add extra functionality 
  to those keystrokes and pass them through to the active application. You will 
  learn how to access menu bars and give keyboard access to commands in the menu 
  system. You will also learn how to type text using scripts.</P>
