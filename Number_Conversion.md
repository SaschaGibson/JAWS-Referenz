# Number Conversion

JAWS integers are assumed to be 16-bit. However, functions are available
for making a 32-bit unsigned long integer, as well as for splitting a
long integer into high and low words. Functions are also available for
converting decimal integers into hexadecimal strings and back again.

For a complete listing of Number Conversion functions, see the topics in
this category book of the Reference Guide.
