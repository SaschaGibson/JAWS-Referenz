<h1>4.1 Script Manager Files</h1>

<p>The Script Manager uses five different files, some of which are created
automatically. All five files are found within your JAWS settings folder. See <a
href="Appendix_D.htm">Naming JAWS Settings Files</a> for more
information on how JAWS derives the names of files created automatically.</p>

<ul>
<li>JSS JAWS Script Source File</li>
<li>JSD JAWS Script Documentation File</li>
<li>JSH JAWS Script Header File</li>
<li>JSM JAWS Script Message File</li>
<li>JSB JAWS Script Binary File</li>
</ul>

<h2>The JAWS Script Source File</h2>

<p>The first file the Script Manager uses is the JAWS script source file. The
script source file is the file that contains all the text of the scripts and
functions you create. This file is essentially a text file with the file
extension of jss.</p>

<p>When you start the Script Manager from an application that is not supported
by Freedom Scientific, the Script Manager automatically creates this file for
the active application. For example when you run the Script Manager from within
Notepad, the Script Manager creates a new script file. The manager creates the
file because Notepad is not supported by Freedom Scientific. In other words,
the script developers at Freedom Scientific have not written any scripts or
user-defined functions for Notepad. See <a
href="04-2_StartingTheScriptManager.htm">section 4.2</a> for more information
on starting the Script Manager.</p>

<h2>The JAWS Script Documentation File</h2>

<p>The second file the Script Manager uses is the JAWS script documentation
file. This file contains the name, synopsis, description, return value, and
parameters for all of the scripts and user-defined functions in the
corresponding script file. Like the script source file, this file is also a
text file with an extension of jsd.</p>

<p>When you activate keyboard help, the information JAWS speaks as you press
keystrokes is retrieved from this file. When you press a keystroke once, JAWS
speaks the synopsis of the script. When you press the same keystroke twice in
succession, JAWS speaks the description.</p>

<h2>The JAWS Script Header and JAWS Script Message Files</h2>

<p>The next files the Script Manager uses contain header and message
information. You can create and modify both of these files using the Script
Manager. The first of these two files is the JAWS script header file and has an
extension of jsh. You use header files to store things such as constant and
global variable definitions. The second of these 2 files is the JAWS script
message file and has a file extension of jsm. You use message files to store
all of the spoken messages used within your script file. </p>

<p>Through the use of the Include statement, you can add the content of both of
these files to as many script files as you want. Storing your constant
definitions, global variable definitions, and messages in header and message
files makes for easier maintenance. For example, when you store all of your
messages in a message file, it is much easier to translate those messages from
English to another language. Instead of searching your entire script file for
all spoken messages, you need only to look at the appropriate message file. See
<a href="05-1_BeforeYouStart.htm#include">5.1 The Include Statement</a> for
more information on including header and message files.</p>

<h2>The JAWS Script Binary File</h2>

<p>The last file used by the Script Manager is the JAWS script binary file.
This file matches the script source file with one exception. The file contains
the machine language used by your computer to determine what action to take
when a script is performed or a user-defined function is called. The file has
an extension of jsb and is created each time you compile your script source
file. You cannot view the contents of this file with the Script Manager or any
other text editor. </p>
