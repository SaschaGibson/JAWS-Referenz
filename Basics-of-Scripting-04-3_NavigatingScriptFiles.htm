<h1>4.3 Navigating Script Files</h1>

<p>You can use a number of different ways to navigate through your script file.
You can navigate line by line, by script, or display a list of all scripts and
user-defined functions within the current script file. </p>

<h2>Navigating by Script</h2>

<p>You can use the Next Script and Prior Script options from within the Script
menu to navigate by script. You can also press <b>F2</b> to move to the next
script and <b>SHIFT+F2</b> to move to the prior script. Each time you press
either keystroke, the insertion point is moved to the beginning line of the
appropriate script and JAWS speaks it automatically. </p>

<p>When you press <b>F2</b> with the insertion point on the last script within
the current script file, a system beep sounds informing you that you have
reached the bottom of the file and have now wrapped around back to the top of
the file. </p>

<p>Likewise, when you press <b>SHIFT+F2 </b>with the insertion point on the
first script in the current script file, a system beep sounds informing you
that you have wrapped around to the bottom of the file. </p>

<h2>Displaying a List of Scripts</h2>

<p>You can display a list of all of the scripts and user-defined functions
contained within your script file. Select the Script List option from the
Script menu or press the keystroke <b>CTRL+L</b>. The Script Manager displays
the list in alphabetic order. Use your arrow keys to move up and down through
the list. You can also use first letter navigation to move directly to a script.</p>

<p>After you have located the desired script, press <b>ENTER</b> to move
directly to the script or function within the script file. You should exercise
care when using this method. Once you press <b>ENTER</b> on the desired script
or function name, the Script Manager moves the insertion point directly to the
beginning line of the script or function. The Script Manager also highlights
the name of the script or function. Since the Script Manager highlights the
name, typing any characters will replace the name of the script or function.
You can press any of the navigation keystrokes to remove the highlight.</p>

<h2>Using Line Numbers</h2>

<p>You can also move directly to any line within your script file. Choose Go To
Line&#8230; from the Script menu or press <b>CTRL+G</b> to display the Go To Line
dialog. You can type the line number in the Line Number edit box and press <b>ENTER</b>
to move the insertion point to the line. The Script Manager displays the line
number along with the total number of lines in the script file in the status
bar at the bottom of the application window.</p>
