# FSAPI

The FSAPI functions much like any other object. In fact, you could
probably use the CreateObject function from the scripts to point to it
and run functions. But this would cause unnecessary overhead, unless you
want to test overhead.

The FSAPI therefore functions like an object model for third party
programs to access JAWS. Even a web page with a Java script could do it
if the security settings were correct.

The FSAPI allows other programs to control Freedom Scientific products.
Currently the only supported product is JAWS. FSAPI has shipped with
JAWS since JAWS 8.0 Update 2.

If you want your program to make JAWS say, Braille, or do something, you
can use the FS API to do it. FSAPI.DLL contains a COM object as well as
several exported functions. This means you can call it through COM. You
will not have to know where FS API lives on the user system, as you
would if it were linked statically. But you can also call FSAPI
functions exports as declared in FSAPI.H if COM cannot be used.

We strongly recommend using COM because this obviates the need to
determine where on the system FSAPI.DLL resides and dynamically load the
library. You cannot really staticly bind to fsapi.lib because your
program will not start if FSAPI.DLL does not reside in the same
directory as the directory where your program is installed. The COM
approach does not suffer from these same limitations.

Note: In Visual Basic, the apostrophe is used for comments rather than
the semicolon.\
A VBScript example of using the COM object is:\

    Set o = CreateObject("freedomsci.jawsapi")
    ' Creates the object variable pointing to FSAPI.
    Call o.SayString("Hello and Hi")
    ' Accesses the member function sayString from FSAPI.
    Call o.RunFunction("sayline")
    ' Accesses the member function sayString from FSAPI.

The available functions are described below.

### SayString

    NAME SayString
    PURPOSE
        Instructs  Jaws to speak a string of text.
    USAGE
        SayString(StrinToSpeak,bInterrupt);
    PARAMETERS
        StrinToSpeak the text to be spoken
        bInterrupt whether or not to discard any text already being spoken at the time this function is called. If this parameter is TRUE, any
        text currently being spoken will be discarded.
    RETURNS
        TRUE ifJaws  is running and if the text was scheduled to be spoken.
        FALSE if the text was not scheduled to be spoken.
    REMARKS
        This function will return before the text has finished speaking

### StopSpeech

    NAME StopSpeech
    PURPOSE
        Instructs  Jaws to stop speaking immediately
    USAGE
        StopSpeech();
    RETURNS
        TRUE if  JAWS is running and if the speech was stopped.
        FALSE if Jaws is not running.

### RunScript

    NAME RunScript
    PURPOSE
        Instructs Jaws  to run a script.
    USAGE
        RunScript(ScriptName);
    PARAMETERS
        ScriptName the name of the  script to be run.
    RETURNS
        TRUE if  Jaws is running and if the script was scheduled to be
        executed.
        FALSE if the script was not scheduled to be executed.
    REMARKS
        A return value of TRUE only indicates that a script execution
        has been scheduled, not that the script has been run. When Jaws tries to execute a script by that name, it first searches for the script in the application script file and then in thedefault  script file. If no such script exists, an error message will be spoken.

### RunFunction

    NAME RunFunction
    PURPOSE
        Instructs Jaws  to run a script function.
    USAGE
        RunFunction(ScriptName);
    PARAMETERS
        FunctionName the name of the  function to be run.
    RETURNS
        TRUE if  Jaws is running and if the function was scheduled to be executed.
        FALSE if the function was not scheduled to be executed.
    REMARKS
        A return value of TRUE only indicates that a function execution has been scheduled, not that the script has been run. When Jaws tries to execute a function by that name, it first searches for the function in the application script file and then in the defaultÂ  script file. If no such function exists, an error message will be spoken.
