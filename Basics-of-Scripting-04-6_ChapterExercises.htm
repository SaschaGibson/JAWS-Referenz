<h1>4.6 Chapter Exercises</h1>

<p>The following exercises give you practice in using many of the functions of
the Script Manager. The objective of the exercise is listed first. </p>

     script or function automatically?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Exercise 4.2: Listing Script and Function Names</h2>

<p>The objective of this exercise is to give you experience activating and
using the Script List dialog. If the Script Manager is already running, make
