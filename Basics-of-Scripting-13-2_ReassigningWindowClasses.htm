<h1>13.2 Reassigning Window Classes</h1>

<p>There is a standard list of window classes used by most programmers during
the development of Windows based applications. The JAWS default scripts contain
the necessary logic to allow proper speaking of these standard classes.
However, application programmers do not always use standard window classes
during application development. Many times, a programmer creates custom window
classes that are non-standard. JAWS is unable to recognize the custom class and
speak the window correctly.</p>

<p>You use JAWS to equate the unknown class to a standard
class to allow JAWS to process the window correctly. This process is called
reassigning the window class. Once you have reassigned a custom window class,
JAWS is able to identify the window and speak it correctly. During window
reassignment, you may need to try more than one class to determine what
standard class works best.</p>

<p>To reassign a window class, you can use the JAWS, invisible or PC cursor to
locate the window. To reassign a window class, do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Move the JAWS, invisible or PC cursor to the window with the non-standard class.</li>
<li>Press <b>INSERT+F2</b> to activate the Run JAWS Manager dialog.</li>
<li>Press <b>W</b> to move to the Window Class Reassign list box item followed by <b>ENTER</b>.</li>
<li>The Window Classes dialog opens with the New Class edit box being the active control. The non-standard window class is shown in this edit box.</li>
<li>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Assign To list box. This list box contains all of the
     standard window classes JAWS recognizes.</li>
<li>Use your arrow keys to move through the list. Select the window class you think
     best suits the non-standard window class.</li>
<li>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Add Class button and press <b>SPACEBAR</b>. You can
     also press <b>ENTER</b> from the Assign To list box to activate the Add Class button.</li>
<li>Press <b>SPACEBAR</b> to activate the Ok button to close the dialog. Focus returns to your application.</li>
</ol>
