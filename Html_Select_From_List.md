# HTML Select From List Functions

Quick navigation allows the virtual cursor to move to types of elements
by pressing a key. In addition, JAWS can show lists of elements to make
it easier to choose a particular type of element. Examples of these
lists are list of buttons, list of edit fields, list of tables, list of
form fields, etc.

For a complete listing of HTML Select From List scripts and functions,
see the topics in this category book of the Reference Guide.
