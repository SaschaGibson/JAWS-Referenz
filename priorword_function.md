# Function: PriorWord

## Description

This performs a special version of the CONTROL+LEFT ARROW or Prior Word
keyboard command. When the PC cursor is active, JAWS allows the
application to move the cursor. When other cursors are active, JAWS

left of the cursor\'s current location. To speak the word at the new
location, place a SayWord function after the PriorWord function.
