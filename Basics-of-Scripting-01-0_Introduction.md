When used with most popular applications, JAWS® screen reading software
provides you with screen information for the application you are using.
The information that tells JAWS how to behave is contained within a set
of "default files." These default files, created by Freedom Scientific,
are provided with JAWS. Unfortunately, not all applications are the
same. Therefore, information telling JAWS how to behave in these
applications is contained in a set of "application-specific files."

Through the many options available in the JAWS application, changes and
adjustments can be easily made to all of the commonly used features,
such as Verbosity and Screen Echo. But despite this ability, you may
find special situations that require more advanced or specific
instructions so that JAWS can properly navigate and provide the correct
screen information in the application.

A script file contains a variety of scripts and functions. You can think
of scripts and functions as small computer programs. Each script or
function contains commands that tell JAWS how to navigate and what to
speak under different conditions. You can modify existing script files
or you can write entirely new commands to make most any application
accessible with JAWS. Moreover, you can create scripts that automate
many of your daily tasks. In short, your use of the scripting language
is endless and is only limited by your imagination and creativity.

JAWS is not the only product developed by Freedom Scientific that takes
advantage of the powerful scripting language. Both the MAGic® screen
magnification application, through the use of the MAGic Pro Scripting
edition, and PAC Mate Omni® accessible Pocket PC device take advantage
of the power and flexibility offered by the scripting language. With the
familiarity gained from writing JAWS scripts, you will be able to easily
apply your skills when generating scripts that control magnification and
speech functionality found in MAGic.

For those of you who ask, \"Do I need a programming background to write
scripts,\" the answer is that while a programming background is helpful,
it is not necessary. In fact, many script developers working for Freedom
Scientific are self-taught. It is for this reason alone that we have
compiled this step-by-step manual in hopes that you will get a good
start toward becoming a successful JAWS script developer.
