# Mouse Speech Events

A Mouse Speech event function provides information about any type of
mouse activity that is spoken. The information may be for a mouse in an
application such as Notepad or Microsoft Word, Google Chrome, etc. But
it might also be for more general operating system features like Windows
Explorer or the Start menu. JAWS uses the information from a Mouse
Speech event function to determine whether to speak and display whether
a mouse movement or activity is occurring. In this case, to display
information refers to showing it in Braille.

An example of a Mouse Speech event function is MouseSpeechTimerEvent.
