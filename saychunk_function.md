# Function: SayChunk

## Description

Says the chunk of information to which the active cursor is pointing. A
chunk is text and graphic information that was written to the screen in
a single operation. SayChunk is similar to SayField. However, the
SayField function uses logic to determine the text that is to be spoken,
while SayChunk simply reads the text that was stored in the off screen
model as a single unit.
