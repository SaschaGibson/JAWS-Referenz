<h1>2.4 Keyboard Manager, Right Hand Pane</h1>

<p>The right hand pane of the Keyboard Manager presents current key map file
information in four columns. The columns of information are: </p>

<ul>
<li>Script name</li>
<li>Keystroke</li>
<li>Key map file name</li>
<li>Key map section</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use your <b>UP</b> and <b>DOWN ARROW</b> keys to move through the
columns of information. As in the left hand pane, you can also use first letter
navigation to move to the first script name that begins with the letter you
have typed.</p>

<h2>Script Name</h2>
<p>The first column of information contains the script name. When you press the
associated keystroke, this is the script that is activated. The actual script
is contained within the corresponding script file with the same name as the
selected key map file whose contents you are reviewing. Examples of script
names include AdjustJAWSOptions, SaySystemTime, and SayCharacter.</p>

<h2>Keystroke</h2>

<p>The second column of information contains the keystroke assignment that
activates the script when the command is pressed. As you move up or down the
list of information, you may notice some script names that do not have
keystroke assignments. In these cases, the Keyboard Manager displays
&quot;none.&quot; This indicates that either a keystroke assignment was never
made, the script is used in conjunction with a Braille display and you do not
have a Braille display, or the script was left over from a previous version of
JAWS and is no longer used. Examples of keystrokes include: <b>JAWS Key+V</b>, <b>JAWS Key+F12</b>, and <b>JAWS Key+NUM PAD 5</b>. </p>

<h2>Key Map File Name</h2>

<p>The third column of information contains the name of the key map file in
which the keystroke assignment is stored. When a keystroke assignment is
located in the default key map file, then the Keyboard Manager displays
&quot;Default&quot; in this column. The Keyboard Manager displays the application
key map file name if the keystroke assignment is specific to that application. </p>

<h2>Key Map Section Name</h2>

<p>The fourth and final column of information contains the key map section.
This is the section of the key map file in which the keystroke assignment is
stored. When this column displays &quot;common,&quot; then the keystroke
assignment is available in both the desktop and laptop keyboard layouts. In
cases where this column displays &quot;desktop,&quot; then the keystroke
assignment is only available when you are using the desktop keyboard layout.
When this column displays &quot;laptop,&quot; then the keystroke is only
available when you are using the laptop keyboard layout. See <a
href="02-7_AddingChangingAndRemovingKeystrokes.htm#add">2.7 Adding
Keystrokes</a> for more information on assigning keystrokes to specific
keyboard layouts.</p>
