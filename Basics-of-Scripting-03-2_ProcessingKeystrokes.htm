<h1>3.2 Processing Keystrokes</h1>

<p>Each time you press a keystroke, JAWS goes through a series of steps to
determine what action to perform. Even though your scripts may have different
names, it is the keystroke binding that determines what script is performed. JAWS
must first determine where the keystroke is assigned. </p>

<h2>Application Key Map</h2>

<p>JAWS first looks for the keystroke assignment within the
application-specific keymap file. If JAWS finds the
keystroke assignment in this file, then the name of the script associated with
the keystroke is remembered.</p>

<h2>Application Script File</h2>

<p>JAWS then looks for the name of the script in the Application-specific
Script file. If JAWS finds the script, then JAWS performs the script and no
further processing is done.</p>

<h2>Default Key Map</h2>

<p>If JAWS does not find the keystroke assignment in the application-specific
key map file, then the default key map file is searched. If JAWS finds the
keystroke assignment in this file, JAWS notes the name of the script activated
by the keystroke. </p>

<p>Before JAWS executes the script, JAWS must determine if the script is
contained in the application-specific script file. If JAWS does not find the
keystroke in the application or default key map files, then the keystroke is
passed through to the application just as if JAWS were not running.</p>

<h2>Application-specific Script File</h2>

<p>JAWS searches the application-specific script file for the script name found
in the default key map file. If JAWS finds the script, then JAWS performs the
script and no further processing is necessary. </p>

<p>If JAWS does not find the script within the application-specific script file
then JAWS searches the default file. If JAWS finds the script in the default
file, then JAWS performs the script and no further processing is required. </p>

<h2>Unknown Script Call</h2>

<p>When JAWS does not find the name of the script attached to the keystroke in
either the application-specific or default script files, then an unknown script
call error message occurs. JAWS speaks &#8220;unknown script call to&#8221;
followed by the name of the script. An unknown script call can occur when
either the script has been deleted from the application-specific or default
script file or when the name of the script is misspelled in the key map or
script file.</p>

<p>To keep these types of errors from occurring, you should use the Script
Manager to remove a script and its associated key map and documentation
entries. </p>

<h2>Pass to Application</h2>

<p>If JAWS does not find the script in either file, then JAWS passes the
keystroke through to the application. The application performs the keystroke
just as if JAWS were not running. JAWS always performs a script in the
application script file rather than a script found in the default script file
even when you make the key assignment in the default key map file. </p>

<h2>Assigning Keystrokes</h2>

<p>You can assign a keystroke to a customized script in an application-specific
script file even though it is assigned in the default key map file. In doing
so, you will not encounter any adverse consequences. When you use a keystroke
that is already defined in the default key map file, the default functionality
is lost for only that application. For example, when you assign <b>CTRL+INSERT+V</b>
to a script contained in the Notepad script file, the default script, SayAppVersion,
is no longer performed. JAWS recognizes the fact that you have used the default
keystroke for an application-specific script. So, JAWS does not perform the SayAppVersion
script when you are using Notepad.</p>

<p>If you give the script in the application-specific file the same name as the
script in the default script file, you do not need to assign a keystroke to the
application-specific script. JAWS performs the script in the application-specific
script file instead of the script found in the default file if they are both
bound to the same keystroke. For example, you can find the AdjustJAWSOptions
script in both the default script file and the Internet Explorer script file.
The keystroke is assigned only in the default key map file. When you press <b>INSERT+V</b>
while you are in Internet Explorer, JAWS finds and performs the
application-specific version of AdjustJAWSOptions. However, when you are using
Notepad and press <b>INSERT+V</b>, JAWS performs the AdjustJAWSOptions script
from the default script file. </p>

<p class="Note"><b>Note:</b> If you attempt to
assign a script to a keystroke which is already in use by the default file,
then JAWS displays a warning dialog. This warning dialog gives you the
opportunity to continue with the assignment or change it to another key. This
is to prevent you from accidentally disabling a script in the default file
without realizing you are doing so.</p>
