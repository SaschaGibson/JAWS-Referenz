# 7.0 Using Variables and Constants

In previous chapters, you created scripts that spoke messages using hard
coded strings of text. You used the SayString and Say built-in functions
to speak those strings of text by typing the text directly into the
parentheses of the function. You had to surround the text with quotation
marks because each function expected a string of text as its parameter.

Instead of using numeric values to represent the output type in the Say
function, you used constants to represent those values. You can find all
of the output type constants in the default constant file, HJConst.jsh.

In this chapter, you will learn how to declare and use variables. You
will learn the differences between local and global variables as well.
You will also learn how to declare your own constant values and then use
them in your scripts.
