# User Options Functions

A User Options function provides or returns information about activities
caused by user interaction with JAWS. However, starting with JAWS 13.0,
the Quick Settings user interface replaced the older style
AdjustJAWSOptions dialog.

For backwards compatibility, many legacy functions for the older style
dialogs continue to ship with JAWS. But all customizations relevant to
Quick Settings should be handled through the Quick Settings functions.
Only in this way can your own customized Quick Settings appear in the
Quick Settings User interface.

Nevertheless, if you still wish to create your own user interface for
customized applications, the legacy functions are still applicable
through the older-style tree view user interface that does not include a
search capability as does Quick Settings or Settings Center.

Some examples of legacy User Options functions include:

- AddCustomNodes
- cStrDefaultList
- OptionsTreeCore

For a complete listing of legacy User Options functions, see the topics
in this category book of the Reference Guide.

For more details on customizing the Quick Settings user interface, see
the topic in the General Scripting Concepts book called [Customized
Quick Settings.](../Customized_Quick_Settings.html)
