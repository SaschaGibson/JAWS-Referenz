# Function: Pause

## Description

Stops the processing of a script so that other applications can complete
tasks. When a pause function is placed in a script, JAWS yields to the
time needs of other applications. Once other applications have been
given the opportunity to use processing time, then JAWS resumes the
script. The pause function is equivalent to using the Delay function
with a value of 1. Do not place a pause command in a While loop, because
this will cause the computer to freeze up.
