# Script: DefineATempPlaceMarker

## Description

While working on web pages, Excel, or even in Word or Email messages,
this feature lets you drop a temporary placemarker that allows you the
ability to return to that spot later, or better yet, select a block of
Text or range of cells. You first use this command to drop the Place
Marker at the location where the selection will begin. Then move to the
location where the selection should end and mark it with the command,
INSERT + SPACE, M. It is similar to how a mouse user would click and
drag across content to be selected and copied.
