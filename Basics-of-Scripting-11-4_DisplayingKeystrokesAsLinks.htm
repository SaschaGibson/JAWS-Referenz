 <H1>11.4 Displaying Keystrokes as Links</H1>
 
<P>In addition to text, you can create keystroke links in the virtual viewer. 
  To create a keystroke link in the virtual viewer, you add the KeyFor function 
  within the body of any individual message stored in a JAWS message file. The 
  KeyFor function requires the name of a script as its only parameter.</P>
<P> When JAWS displays the message containing the KeyFor function in the virtual 
  viewer, JAWS retrieves the keystroke for the script named passed as a parameter 
  to the function. The keystroke is displayed as a link that you can activate 
  by pressing <strong>ENTER</strong> on the line containing the keystroke.
<p>
  The keystroke is displayed in underlined, blue text on the same white background 
  as other text contained within the viewer. The syntax for using the KeyFor function 
  in a message follows:</p>
<p class="Code">%KeyFor(ScriptName)</p>
<p> The percent sign preceding the function name acts as a placeholder for the 
  keystroke within the message. The script name does not include the parentheses 
  and can be located in either the default or application-specific script file. 
  An example of a message that contains the KeyFor function follows:</p>
<p class="Code">@MSGVirtualViewer<br>
This text is being displayed in the virtual viewer. <br>
If you want to see a list of general JAWS hot keys, press %KeyFor (HotKeyHelp).<br>
@@</p>
<p>JAWS displays the message in the virtual viewer as:</p>
<p> This text is being displayed in the virtual viewer. <br>
  If you want to see a list of general JAWS hot keys, press JAWSKey+H.</p>
<p> JAWS displays the portion of the message, &#8220;This text is being displayed 
  in the virtual viewer,&#8220; in black text on a white background. JAWS displays 
  the portion of the message, &#8220;If you want to see a list of general JAWS 
  hot keys, press JAWSKey+H,&#8220; in blue text on a white background. The text 
  is displayed in blue text on a white background to indicate visually the text 
  is part of the keystroke link, <strong>INSERT+H</strong>. JAWS also indicates 
  verbally that this text is a link.
