# 2.2 Keyboard Manager Files

The Keyboard Manager uses two types of key map files:

- Default
- Application

All key map files have the file extension of .jkm.

The \'default\' key map file contains the keystroke assignments for the
default script file. JAWS loads the default key map file into memory
each time you start JAWS. The default set of keystroke assignments are
always available for your use.

The \'application\' key map files contain keystroke assignments for
scripts in an application script file. All application key map files
have the same name as the application\'s script file. For example, the
script file name for Microsoft® Word 2007 is Microsoft Word 2007.jss.
Thus, the key map file for Word is Microsoft Word.jkm. See [Naming JAWS
Settings Files](Appendix_D.htm) for more information on how JAWS derives
the names of key map files.

When you have an application plus the JAWS program open on your
computer, JAWS employs both the associated application key map file and
the default key map file so that both sets of keystroke assignments are
available.

For those applications where the application and default key map files
share the same keystroke assignment, the keystroke assignment in the
application key map file always takes precedence over the keystroke
assignment in the default key map file.
