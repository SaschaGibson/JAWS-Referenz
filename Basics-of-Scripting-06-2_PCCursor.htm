<h1>6.2 PC Cursor</h1>

<p>You can think of the PC cursor as the system focus. This cursor is linked to
the keyboard functions of the Windows operating system and Windows based applications.
This is the cursor that is used when typing information, moving through options
in dialog boxes, and selecting options or icons. You can move the PC cursor
using a variety of navigation keystrokes such as<b> PAGE UP</b>, <b>PAGE DOWN</b>,
<b>HOME</b>, and <b>END</b>. You can also use the arrow keys to move the
cursor. However, the PC cursor can only go where your application allows it to
go.</p>

<p>You will have to use another cursor when the text is not within the range of
movement of the PC cursor. You can use many of the built-in functions to move
the PC cursor within the areas to which it is limited.</p>

<h2>Activating the PC Cursor</h2>

<p>You do most of the reading in any window using the PC cursor. You can use
the built-in function, PCCursor, to activate the cursor from within a script or
user-defined function. </p>

<p>When you use the PCCursor function, the PC cursor is activated just as if
you pressed <b>NUM PAD PLUS </b>from your keyboard. </p>
