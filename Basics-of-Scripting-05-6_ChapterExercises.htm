<h1>5.6 Chapter Exercises</h1>

<p>These exercises will give you practice in creating, inserting functions,
compiling, and testing your scripts.</p>

<h2>Exercise 5.1: Adding Comments and Include Statements</h2>

<p>The objective of this exercise is to give you some practice adding comments
and include statements to your script file. </p>

<p>Before you begin this exercise, make sure you only have JAWS and Notepad
running. You can press <b>INSERT+F10</b> to list all of your running applications.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Press <b>INSERT+F2</b> followed by <b>S</b> and <b>ENTER</b> while Notepad is the active
     application. This opens The Script Manager with the Notepad.jss file in
     the edit window.</li>
</ol>

<p class="Note"><b>Note:</b> Unless you have
written any scripts in the Notepad script source file, this file will be empty.</p>

<ol start=2>
 <li>Press <b>CTRL+HOME</b> to move to the top of the file. This ensures the insertion
     point is at the top of the script file.</li>
</ol>

<p class="Note"><b>Note: </b>If the insertion point
is already at the top of the file, you may hear a windows system sound.</p>

<ol start=3>
 <li>Type a semicolon (;). This starts a comment line in the script file.</li>
 <li>Type the text "JAWS [ version ] Script file for Notepad in Windows X"
     where X denotes the operating system you are using and version denotes the
     version of JAWS you are writing scripts for. At the end of this line,
     press <b>ENTER</b> to move the insertion point to the next line.</li>
 <li>Type a semicolon (;) to begin a second comment line in your script file.</li>
 <li>Type the text of "Written By" followed by your name and the current date.
     At the end of this line press <b>ENTER</b> to complete the line and move
     the insertion point to a new blank line.</li>
 <li>Press <b>ENTER</b> twice. This will create a blank line and then move the insertion point to
     a second blank line after your comment section. This will help separate
     the comment section from the area where include statements are placed.</li>
 <li>Type include "HJConst.jsh" This adds an include statement telling
     JAWS to include the contents of the HJConst.jsh file within the Notepad
     script file. Press <b>ENTER</b> to complete the line and move the
     insertion point to a new blank line.</li>
</ol>

<p class="Note"><b>Note: </b>When you type the
include statement, the file name must be surrounded by quotation marks.</p>

<ol start=9>
 <li>Press <b>CTRL+W</b> to save your script file without compiling.</li>
</ol>

<p>After completing the steps above, your Notepad script file should start with
the following lines:</p>

<p class="Code">
; JAWS [ version ] Script file for Notepad in Windows X<br>
; Written by your name on mm/dd/yy<br>
include "hjconst.jsh"</p>

<p class="Note"><b>Note: </b>The text of your name
should be replaced with your actual name. The date should also be filled in for
the date you are doing this exercise.</p>

<h2>Exercise 5.2: The
HelloWorld Script</h2>

<p>The objective of this exercise is to use the New Script dialog to create
your first script. If you have just completed the previous exercise, make sure
that Script Manager is the active application. If you have closed the Script
Manager, make sure Notepad is still running, switch to Notepad, and follow step
1 in the previous exercise to start the manager.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Press <b>CTRL+END</b> to move to the bottom of the Notepad script file. This will ensure your
     new script is created at the bottom of the file below the comments you
     added in the previous exercise.</li>
 <li>Press <b>ENTER</b> twice to create a blank line between the Include statement and your new
     script.</li>
 <li>Press <b>CTRL+E </b>to display the New Script dialog. The Script Name edit box is active.</li>
 <li>Type HelloWorld In the Script Name edit box.</li>
</ol>

<p class="Note"><b>Note: </b>Script names cannot
contain spaces or any punctuation marks such as dashes or underlines. The
Script Manager will cause a system beep to occur any time you attempt to add
any of these characters to your new
script name. You should also
capitalize the first letter of each word in a multiple word script name.</p>

<ol start=5>
 <li>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Can be Attached to Key check box and press <b>SPACEBAR</b>.
     This step tells JAWS you want to create a script and not a function.</li>
 <li>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Synopsis edit box. Type "Speaks a message in Notepad" into this edit box without the quotation marks. This text is
     spoken by JAWS when you enter Keyboard Help and press the keystroke that
     activates this script.</li>
 <li>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Description edit box. Type "Speaks a hello world message in Notepad." without the quotation marks. The description is
     heard when you enter keyboard help and press the keystroke that activates
     this script twice in succession.</li>
 <li>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Category list box. Since this is not used, you do not need
     to select an item from this list.</li>
 <li>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Assign To edit box. Be careful as any keystroke you press
     while in this edit box will be used as the keystroke that activates this
     script. Press <b>CTRL</b> simultaneously with <b>1</b> in the numbers row,
     not the number pad. Since the Ok button is the default button in this
     dialog, you can press <b>ENTER</b> to close the New Script dialog and
     return to the Notepad script file.</li>
 <li>Press <b>UP ARROW </b>once to move the insertion point to the first blank line in the
     body of the script. Type the following text:</li>
</ol>

<p class="code">SayString ("Hello World!")</p>

<p class="Note"><b>Note: </b>The SayString function
is no longer used to speak messages with JAWS. This function is obsolete and
should only be used for debugging scripts and functions.</p>

<ol start=11>
 <li>After you have typed the line of text above, the insertion point is at the end of
     the line. Press <b>DOWN ARROW</b> once to move to the next line. You can
     press <b>DELETE</b> twice to remove the remaining blank lines.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you have followed the steps above, you should have the following
script in your script file:</p>

<p class="Code">Script HelloWorld ()<br>
SayString ("Hello World!")<br>
EndScript</p>

<p>If your script does not look like the one above, make corrections as needed.
You can edit the text of any script just as you would in a word processor or
text editor.</p>

<h2>Exercise 5.3: Compiling and testing the HelloWorld Script</h2>

<p>The objective of this exercise is to compile and test the HelloWorld script
created in exercise 5.2.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Press <b>CTRL+S</b> to save and compile the Notepad.jss script file. Did you hear the
     &quot;Compile Complete&quot; message? If not, go back to the script and
     check it against the script shown in the previous exercise.</li>
 <li>After you have successfully compiled your script file, you are ready to test your
     new script. Press <b>ALT+TAB</b> to move back to Notepad.</li>
 <li>Press <b>CTRL+1</b>.  Did you hear the message spoken by JAWS?</li>
 <li>Press <b>INSERT+1</b> to turn on Keyboard Help. You should hear JAWS speak &quot;Keyboard help
     on&quot; when you are using beginner verbosity. Otherwise, you should hear
     , &quot;On.&quot;</li>
 <li>Press the keystroke that activates your script, <b>CTRL+1</b>. Did JAWS speak the synopsis of your script?</li>
 <li>Press the keystroke, <b>CTRL+1</b>, twice in succession. Did JAWS speak the
     description of your script?</li>
 <li>Press <b>INSERT+1</b> a second time. You will hear JAWS say &quot;Keyboard help
     off&quot; when you are using beginner verbosity. Otherwise, you should
     hear , &quot;Off.&quot;</li>
</ol>

<h2>Exercise 5.4: Using the Insert Function dialog.</h2>

<p>The objective of this exercise is to create a new script and insert a
function in the body of the script using the Insert Function dialog. If you are
still in Notepad, press <b>ALT+TAB</b> to move back to the Script Manager.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Press <b>CTRL+END</b> to move to the bottom of the file.</li>
 <li>Press <b>ENTER</b> twice to create a new blank line. This blank line separates the new script
     from the previous HelloWorld script.</li>
 <li>Press <b>CTRL+E</b> to activate the New Script dialog. Your cursor should be located in
     the Script Name edit box.</li>
 <li>Type SayGreeting without spaces. Capitalize the <b>S</b> in say and the <b>G</b>
     in Greeting.</li>
 <li>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Can be Attached to Key check box and press <b>SPACEBAR</b>
     to check it. This tells JAWS you are creating a script not a function.</li>
 <li>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the synopsis edit box. Type &quot;Speaks a greeting in Notepad&quot;.</li>
 <li>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the description edit box. Type &quot;Speaks a greeting in
     Notepad using the Say function.&quot;</li>
 <li>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the category combo box. As the category is not used, you do not
     need to make a selection.</li>
 <li>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Assign To edit box. Press <b>CTRL</b> simultaneously with
     the <b>2</b> on your numbers row, not the num pad. You should hear JAWS speak
     &quot;<b>CTRL+2</b>.&quot; Since the Ok button is the default button in
     this dialog, press <b>ENTER</b> to close the New Script dialog.</li>
 <li>Press <b>UP ARROW</b> once to move to the first blank line in the body of your new script.</li>
 <li>Press <b>CTRL+I</b> to activate the Insert Function dialog box. The cursor should be located in the Function Name edit box.</li>
 <li>Type &quot;Say.&quot; JAWS moves the highlight in the Function Name list box of this dialog to the location of the Say function and speaks its
     description.</li>
 <li>Press <b>ENTER</b> to tell JAWS this is the function you want to add to your script. You will
     then be prompted for the first parameter of the function. This parameter
     is the string of text that is spoken by JAWS each time you press <b>CTRL+2</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p class="Note"><b>Note:</b> A parameter is information a function uses to perform its task.</p>

<ol start=14>
 <li>Type &quot;Hello world, this is my second script.&quot; including the quotation
     marks. This is the actual message JAWS speaks each time you press <b>CTRL+2</b>.</li>
 <li>Press <b>ENTER</b> to add the first parameter. You will then be prompted for the second
     parameter of the Say function.</li>
 <li>Type &quot;OT_MESSAGE&quot; in all capital letters. This is a constant value
     contained within the HJConst.jsh script header file. This parameter tells
     JAWS what type of message this is and when to speak it.</li>
 <li>Press <b>ENTER</b> to accept the second parameter. Press <b>ENTER</b> again to leave the
     third parameter empty and close the Insert Function dialog box. You are
     returned to the script file and the insertion point is at the end of the
     line containing the function you just inserted.</li>
 <li>Press the <b>LEFT ARROW KEY</b> to move the cursor back into the text of the function and
     you will find a blank space and a comma in between the OT_MESSAGE and the
     right parenthesis at the end of the function. This happened because we
     chose to leave the third parameter of the Say function blank. In order for
     the script to compile properly, you must delete the blank space and the
     comma in between the OT_MESSAGE and the right parenthesis.</li>
 <li>Press <b>DOWN ARROW</b> once to move to the next blank line. Press <b>DELETE</b> twice
     to remove the two remaining blank lines. After following the steps above,
     your script should look like the following:</li>
</ol>

<p class="Code">
Script SayGreeting ()<br>
Say ("Hello world, this is my second script", OT_MESSAGE)<br>
EndScript</p>

<ol start=19>
 <li>Now you are ready to compile the script. Press <b>CTRL+S</b> to compile the script
     file. If you don't hear &quot;compile complete&quot;, then you may have an
     error in your script. Go back and review the script. You should make sure
     your script matches the script shown above. After you have corrected any
     errors, try compiling the script again.</li>
 <li>Once you save and compile your script without any errors, return to Notepad and
     test your script. Press <b>CTRL+2</b>. Did JAWS speak the message?</li>
