# Function: PriorCharacter

## Description

This performs a special version of the LEFT ARROW or Prior Character
keyboard command. When the PC cursor is active, JAWS allows the
application to move the cursor. When other cursors are active, JAWS

the left of the cursor\'s current location. To speak the information at
the new cursor location, place a SayCharacter function after the
PriorCharacter function.
