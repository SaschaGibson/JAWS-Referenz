 <H1>5.2 The New Script Dialog</H1>
 
<P>To create a new script within the current script file, choose New Script from 
  the Script menu or press <b>CTRL+E</b>. After you have initiated the new script 
  action, the Script Manager displays the New Script dialog and the Script Name 
  edit box is active. The New Script dialog is a multipage dialog. The first page, 
  General, is identical to the General page in the Script Information dialog discussed 
  previously in 4.5 Viewing Script Information. You can enter the script name, 
  check the attach to check box, enter the synopsis and description, and assign 
  a keystroke within this page. The second page, Parameters, contains parameter 
  information for functions you create. You can press <b>CTRL+TAB </b>to move 
  between the 2 pages. </P>
<P>The Script Manager writes all the information you enter in this dialog to the 
  documentation file that corresponds to the current script source file. For example, 
  the spreadsheet.exe application mentioned earlier has a script file name of 
  Spreadsheet.jss. The corresponding documentation file, or .jsd file, has the 
  name of Spreadsheet.jsd. </P>
<h2>General Page</h2>
<P>This is the first page of the New Script multipage dialog. You use this page 
  to enter all the basic information about your new script or function. You can 
  use <b>TAB</b> and <b>SHIFT+TAB</b> to move between the controls on this page.</P>
<h3>Script Name</h4>
<P>When you first initiate the new script action, this edit box is active. You 
  enter the name of your script here. It is helpful to use a name that is descriptive 
  of the action the script performs. You may use several words concatenated together. 
  For example, in MySampleScript, start each word with a capital letter so JAWS 
  will pronounce the name as separate words. The script name cannot contain spaces 
  or punctuation, only alpha numeric characters. If you try to enter spaces or punctuation in the script name, you will hear an audible beep from the computer.</P>
<h3>Can be Attached to Key</h3>
<P>Press the <b>SPACEBAR</b> to check this item when you want to create a script. 
  If you leave this check box unchecked, you will create a function instead of 
  a script. Remember that scripts can be attached to keys but functions cannot.</P>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<P>Type a brief statement of what the script does in this field. JAWS speaks this 
  information when you or other users access Keyboard help mode (<b>INSERT+1</b>) 
  or Key Word help (<b>SHIFT+F1</b>). To hear synopsis help, press the <b>INSERT+1</b> 
  key combination using the 1 on the number row, not the number pad 1. JAWS says 
  &quot;keyboard help on.&quot; Next, press the keystroke combination that activates 
  your script. JAWS should say the information placed in this edit box. You can 
  leave the keyboard help mode by pressing <b>INSERT+1</b> a second time.</P>
<h3>Description</h3>
<P>Enter a more detailed explanation of the action the script performs in this 
  edit box. This description is used if you enter the Keyboard help mode (<b>INSERT+1</b>) 
  or Key Word help (<b>SHIFT+F1</b>) in the Script Manager. The description is 
  spoken by quickly pressing the key combination (that activates your script) 
  twice after turning Keyboard Help on.</P>
<h3>Category</h3>
<P>You can type in a category name or choose one from the drop down combo box. 
  This feature is not in use so you do not need to select a category at this time.</P>
<h3>Assign To</h3>
<P>This edit box is only available if you checked the Can Be Attached to Key check 
  box. Type the keystroke combination you wish to use for your script. For example, 
  to enter <b>CTRL+ALT+Z</b>, press and hold the <b>CTRL</b> and <b>ALT</b> keys 
  while pressing the <b>Z </b>key. If the choice you make is already assigned 
  to another script, the Script Manager displays an error dialog. You can continue 
  with the assignment or choose a different keystroke combination.</P>
<P>You cannot use standard reading commands to review the keystroke you have entered. For example, if you press <b>INSERT+UP ARROW</b> to try and read the keystroke you have entered, JAWS will think you are wanting to use <b>INSERT+UP ARROW</b> as the keystroke to activate the script. To review your keystroke selection, press <b>TAB</b> to move away from the edit box and then <b>SHIFT+TAB</b> to return. JAWS will automatically read the keystroke you entered.</P>
<h3>Function Returns</h3>
<P>This choice is only available if you did not check the Can Be Attached to Key 
  check box. You can type in a Return Name or choose one from the drop-down combo 
  box. Among the choices are Handle, Int, Object, String, or Void. Select the 
  type of return that your function is designed to return to the calling script. 
  Select Void if you do not need to use any value returned by the function. The 
  return type appears on the first line of the function before the word Function.</P>
<h3>Return Description</h3>
<P>This choice is only available if you did not check the Can Be Attached to Key 
  check box. Enter a brief description of the information that is being returned 
  by the function and how the information is to be used.</P>
<h2>Parameters Page</h2>
<P>This is the second page of the New Script multipage dialog. You use this page 
  to enter all parameters that are to be used by your new function. You will not 
  use this page of the new script dialog unless you are creating a function. You 
  can use <b>TAB</b> and <b>SHIFT+TAB</b> to move between the controls on this 
  page. </P>
<P>The Parameters page will be discussed in greater detail later in this manual.</P>
