# Miscellaneous Functions

A Miscellaneous function is one that does not fit neatly into any of the
other categories. JAWS uses information returned by these functions, as
with most others, to determine whether or what to speak and display in
Braille, for comparison purposes, etc.

Many scripts fall into the category of Miscellaneous, such as the script
for MinimizeAllApps, for example. However, the focus of the present
discussion is on Miscellaneous functions that you may call from your own
scripts AND FUNCTIONS, or that you may overwrite from those in
default.jss or from the built-in functions.

Some examples of Miscellaneous functions include:

- IsRTLLanguageProcessorLoaded
- ArrayLength
- GetVariantType

For a complete listing of Miscellaneous functions, see the topics in the
category book of the Reference Guide.
