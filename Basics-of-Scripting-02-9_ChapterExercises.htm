 <H1>2.9 Chapter Exercises</H1>
 
<P>The following exercises give you practice in using many of the functions of 
  the Keyboard Manager. The objective of the exercise is listed first. </P>
<h2>Exercise 2.1: Finding a Keystroke</h2>
<P>The objective of this exercise is to find a specific keystroke within the default 
  key map file and view the corresponding script documentation. </P>
<ol>
  <li> Press <b>INSERT+F2 </b>to display the Run JAWS Managers dialog.</li>
  <li>Type <b>K</b> to select the Keyboard Manager option followed by <b>ENTER</b>. 
    This action starts the Keyboard Manager.</li>
  <li> Press<b> INSERT+UP ARROW</b> to read the current line. This is the current 
    key map file. Did the selected key map file match the active application?</li>
  <li> Press <b>CTRL+SHIFT+D</b> to select the default key map file. The contents 
    of the file are shown in the right hand pane of the Keyboard Manager.</li>
  <li> Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the right hand pane of the manager. How many 
    items does JAWS tell you are contained in the list?</li>
  <li>Press <b>CTRL+F</b> to activate the Find Keystroke dialog.</li>
  <li>Press <b>INSERT+F12</b>. JAWS speaks the keystroke after you press it as 
    <b>JAWS KEY+F12</b>. The keystroke is also shown in the Search for Key edit 
    box.</li>
  <li>Press <b>ENTER</b> to begin the search. Did JAWS find the keystroke? Did 
    JAWS read the script name, keystroke, key map file name and section? If you 
    did not hear this information, press <b>INSERT+UP ARROW </b>to read the current 
    line and repeat the information.</li>
  <li>Press <b>CTRL+D</b> to activate and display the Script Information dialog. 
    Press <b>TAB</b> and <b>SHIFT+TAB</b> to move to and read the edit boxes contained 
    in the dialog.</li>
  <li>Press <b>ESCAPE</b> to close the dialog after you have reviewed the script 
    information.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Exercise 2.2: Adding a Keystroke</h2>
<P>The objective of this exercise is to locate a specific keystroke in the default 
  key map file and add a second keystroke to the script attached to that keystroke. 
  If you already have the Keyboard Manager running, you can move to it by pressing<b> 
  ALT+TAB</b>. If the Keyboard Manager is not running, then follow steps 1 through 
  3 in exercise 2.1 to start the Keyboard Manager and open the default key map 
  file.</P>
<ol>
  <li> Press <b>CTRL+F</b> to activate the Find Keystroke dialog.</li>
  <li> Press <b>INSERT+F11</b>. This is the keystroke for which we want to search. 
    JAWS echoes the keystroke as you press it and <b>JAWS KEY+F11</b>1 is placed 
    in the Search for Key edit box.</li>
  <li>Press <b>ENTER</b> to begin the search. When JAWS finds the keystroke, the 
    information is selected and spoken automatically by JAWS.</li>
</ol>
<P class="Note"><b>Note:</b> If the keystroke was not found, then the 
  Keystroke Not Found dialog is displayed.</P>
<ol start="4">
  <li>Press <b>CTRL+A</b> to activate the Add Keystroke dialog. The Assign To 
    edit box is active.</li>
  <li> Press <b>CTRL+F11</b>. JAWS echoes the keystroke and <b>CTRL+F11</b> is 
    placed in the Assign To edit box.</li>
  <li>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Assign To X Keys Only check box where X 
    represents the keyboard layout in use. If you are using the desktop layout 
    then this is the Assign Key To Desktop Keys Only checkbox.</li>
  <li>Press <b>SPACEBAR</b> to uncheck the Assign Keys to X check box.</li>
  <li>Press <b>ENTER</b> to activate the Ok button in the Add Keystroke dialog. 
    Since the default button is the Ok button, the dialog is closed. Next, the 
    Confirm Add Keystroke dialog is displayed.</li>
  <li>Press <b>SPACEBAR</b> to activate the Yes button. The Confirm Add Keystroke 
    dialog is closed and you are returned to the Keyboard Manager.</li>
  <li>Press <b>INSERT+UP ARROW</b> to read the current line. Did you hear the 
    original keystroke information for <b>INSERT+F11</b> spoken by JAWS?</li>
  <li>Press <b>DOWN ARROW</b> to move to the next entry in the list. Did you hear 
    the new keystroke echoed by JAWS? If you want to repeat the information, press 
    <b>INSERT+UP ARROW</b> to read the current line.</li>
</ol>
<P>After you have completed the steps above, be sure to test both new and old 
  keystrokes. Do they both work?</P>
<h2>Exercise 2.3: Changing an Existing Keystroke</h2>
<P>The objective of this exercise is to locate the keystroke we just added in 
  the previous exercise and change it. You should still have the Keyboard Manager 
  running with the default key map file open. If you closed the Keyboard Manager, 
  follow steps 1 through 3 from exercise 2.1 to activate the Keyboard Manager 
  and open the default key map file.</P>
<ol>
  <li>Press <b>CTRL+F </b>to activate the Find Keystroke dialog. The focus is 
    in the Search for Key edit box.</li>
  <li>Press <b>CTRL+F11</b>. This is the keystroke for which the search is carried 
    out. JAWS speaks the keystroke and <b>CTRL+F11 </b>is displayed in the Search 
    for Key edit box.</li>
  <li>Press <b>ENTER</b> to activate the Ok button. The find keystroke action 
    is performed. When the keystroke is found, the keystroke information is spoken 
    automatically by JAWS.</li>
  <li>Press <b>CTRL+H</b> to activate the Change Keystroke dialog. The Assign 
    To edit box is active in this dialog.</li>
  <li>Press <b>SHIFT+F11</b>. This is the new keystroke. JAWS echoes the keystroke 
    and <b>SHIFT+F11</b> is placed in the assign To edit box.</li>
  <li>Press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Assign to X Keys Only check box, where X 
    represents the keyboard layout in use. . If you are using the desktop layout, 
    then this check box is labeled as Assign to Desktop Keys Only.</li>
  <li>Press <b>SPACEBAR</b> to uncheck the Assign to Desktop Keys Only checkbox.</li>
  <li>Press <b>ENTER</b> to activate the Ok button. The Change Keystroke dialog 
    closes. The Confirm Change Keystroke dialog box is then displayed and the 
    Yes button is active. </li>
  <li>Press <b>SPACEBAR</b> to activate the Yes button. The Confirm Change Keystroke 
    dialog closes and you are returned to the Keyboard Manager.</li>
  <li>Press<b> INSERT+UP ARROW</b> to read the current line. What keystroke information 
    was spoken by JAWS? </li>
  <li>Since the current keystroke entry is not the changed entry, press <b>UP 
    ARROW</b> to move to the prior entry. Is this your new keystroke?</li>
</ol>
<P>After you have followed the steps above, be sure to test both the old and new 
  keystrokes. Do they both work as expected? </P>
<h2>Exercise 2.4: Removing a Keystroke</h2>
<P>The objective of this exercise is to find the keystroke we changed in the previous 
  exercise and remove it. This will leave only the original keystroke to list 
  the items in the system tray. </p>
  <P>If the Keyboard Manager is not running already refer to steps 1 through 3 in 
  exercise 2.1 to start the Keyboard Manager and open the default key map file.</P>
<ol>
  <li> Press <b>CTRL+F </b>to activate the Find Keystroke dialog. The Search for 
    key edit box is active.</li>
  <li> Press <b>SHIFT+F11</b>. This is the keystroke for which the search is carried 
    out. JAWS echoes the keystroke and <b>SHIFT+F11</b> is placed in the Search 
    for Key edit box.</li>
  <li> Press <b>ENTER</b> to perform the Find Keystroke action. When the keystroke 
    is found, the information is highlighted and spoken automatically by JAWS.</li>
  <li> Press <b>DELETE</b> to remove the keystroke. The Remove Keystroke dialog 
    is displayed and the Yes button is active.</li>
  <li>Press <b>SPACEBAR</b> to activate the Yes button and close the Confirm Remove 
    Keystroke dialog. The keystroke is removed from the default key map file.</li>
  <li> Press <b>INSERT+UP ARROW</b> to read the current line. Is the <b>SHIFT+F11</b> 
    keystroke gone? Is the default keystroke, <b>INSERT+F11</b>, the only keystroke 
    displayed?</li>
