 <H1>5.3 Parts of a Script</H1>

<P>When you use the New Script dialog to create a new script or function, the
  Script Manager automatically places 3 pieces of information into the current
  script file. These three parts make up your script or function.</P>
<h2>Beginning Line</h2>
<P>Each new script or function you create has a beginning line that is created
  when you enter the script or function information into the New Script dialog.
  The contents of the beginning line vary depending on whether you created a script
  or function. When you create a new script, the following line begins the script
  definition:</P>

<P class="Code">
Script ScriptName ()</P>

<P>On the other hand, when you create a function the following line is added to
  your script file:</P>
<P class="Code">Void Function FunctionName (parameter list)</P>
<P>Remember that a function always has a return type. This return type can be
  a handle, integer (Int), object, or string. The function can also return nothing.
  In cases where the function returns nothing to the calling script or function,
  the word void is shown as the return type.</P>
<P>If the function uses any parameters, they are shown between the parentheses
  following the function name.</p>
  <P>If you decide to change the name of your script or function in the beginning
  line, it is best to change the name through the Script Information dialog. When
  you make changes using the General page of the Script Information dialog, the
  script or function name is changed automatically for you in the associated documentation
  file. Likewise if you forgot to add a parameter to your new function, you can
  use the Parameters page of the Script Information dialog to add it. See <a href="04-5_ViewingInformation.htm">section
  4.5</a> for more information on displaying the Script Information dialog.
</P>
<h2>The Body</h2>
<P>The body immediately follows the beginning line of the script or function.
  When you create a new script or function, the body is the three blank lines immediately
  following the script or function beginning line. You add all the instructions
  your script needs to perform its given task here. These instructions are also
  referred to as statements. Each type of script statement has a specific job
  to perform, and each follows certain formatting and usage rules known as syntax.
</P>
<h2>Ending Line</h2>
<P>Each new script or function you create also has an ending line. This line ends
  the individual script or function. This is always the last line of your script
  or function. When you create a new script, the ending line looks like the following:</P>
<P class="Code">EndScript</P>
<P>On the other hand, the ending line of a user-defined function looks like the
  following:</P>
<P class="Code">EndFunction</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
