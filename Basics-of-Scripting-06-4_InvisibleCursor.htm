 <H1>6.4 Invisible Cursor</H1>
 
<P>The Invisible cursor was created for the sole purpose of accessing information 
  on the screen. You have probably not used the Invisible cursor during your daily 
  use of JAWS. The Invisible cursor is identical to the JAWS cursor. You can move 
  it anywhere on the screen, but you cannot perform any mouse actions such as 
  a left mouse click. </P>
<P>You use the same navigation keystrokes as you do when other cursors are active. 
  You can activate the Invisible cursor from your keyboard by pressing <b>NUM 
  PAD MINUS</b> twice in succession. When you only need to read information on 
  the screen, then the Invisible cursor is the best cursor to use.</P>
<h2>Activating the Invisible Cursor</h2>
<P>You can use the built-in function, InvisibleCursor to activate the Invisible cursor 
  regardless of its location on your screen. The InvisibleCursor function activates 
  the cursor just like using <b>NUM PAD MINUS</b> twice from your keyboard.</P>
