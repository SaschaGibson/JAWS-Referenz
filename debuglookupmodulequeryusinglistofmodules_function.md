# Function: DebugLookupModuleQueryUsingListOfModules

## Description

Debug output for rule set. Error codes / text are placed in the Virtual
Viewer for developers of rule sets and/or modules. This function only
displays what\'s thrown up by Invoke calls. No parameters, as it runs as
a stand-alone providing both a list of available rule sets and a prompt
to enter the search term. To make your rule set discoverable first, put
at least a dummy version of the files into the RuleSets folder of your
subdirectory. Then go to Settings Center \| Research It and make sure
yours is checked, so it\'s available for listing. When asked for the
search term, press ESC to send a blank string, or type the term and
press ENTER. Note that in JAWS 12 or later, Settings Center replaces
Configuration Manager.
