 <H1>6.7 Speaking the Information</H1>
 
<P>As you learned in the previous section, the movement functions built into JAWS 
  only move the cursor, but do not speak any information. You must use another 
  built-in function to actually speak the information found at the active cursor 
  location. </P>
<P>In section 6.1 you used a number of keystrokes to move 
  the JAWS cursor to read the bottom line of the active window. You used <b>INSERT+UP 
  ARROW</b> to read the contents of the bottom line of the window as the last 
  step. If you were to look at the actual code of the SayLine script, you would 
  see the script uses a built-in function, SayLine, to read the current line. 
</P>
<P>You can use built-in functions to read the current character, word, line, and 
  more. You can also use built-in functions to read information from the cursor 
  location to either the beginning of the line or the end of the line. You can 
  use the functions listed below to read a specific piece of information. For 
  example, the SayCharacter function speaks the current character while the SayWord 
  function speaks the current word. The list of functions follows:</P>
<ul>
  <li>SayCharacter ()</li>
  <li>SayChunk ()</li>
  <li>SayField ()</li>
  <li>SayLine ()</li>
  <li>SayParagraph ()</li>
  <li>SaySentence ()</li>
  <li>SayWord ()</li>
</ul>
<P>The functions listed below all speak information beginning at the location 
  of the active cursor:</P>
<ul>
  <li>SayFromCursor ()</li>
  <li>SayToCursor ()</li>
  <li>SayToBottom ()</li>
  <li>SayToPunctuation ()</li>
</ul>
<P class="Note"><b>Note: </b>You can find more information for any of 
  the functions listed above by reviewing the documentation file for functions 
  built into JAWS, builtin.jsd. You can view this file in the Script Manager or 
  in any text editor. You can find this file in the JAWS shared settings folder. Navigate to the JAWS program group in the Start menu and choose Explore JAWS > Explore   Shared Settings. This opens a Windows Explorer screen where you can find all of the original JAWS script files.</P>
