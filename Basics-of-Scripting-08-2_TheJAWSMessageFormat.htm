<h1>8.2 The JAWS Message Format</h1>

<p>The JAWS message format was first introduced in JAWS 4.0. This new message
format replaced the need for concatenating message constants together to
produce a single message. The message format also makes modifying your messages
much easier. You do not have to worry about surrounding the entire message text
in quotation marks.</p>

<p>The JAWS message format consists of the following parts:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Messages</li>
 <li>@MsgName</li>
 <li>message body</li>
 <li>@@</li>
 <li>EndMessages</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beginning the Block of Messages</h2>

<p>You use the key word, Messages, to begin the entire block of messages. You
place this key word at the beginning of your message file. You only use this
key word once within the message file. This key word tells JAWS that anything
following the word is part of your messages block.</p>

<h2>Beginning an Individual Message</h2>

<p>All of your individual messages immediately follow the Messages key word.
You start each individual message with the @ symbol followed by the name of the
message. When you name your messages, it is often helpful to begin the name
with &quot;Msg.&quot; When you start each message in this way, you will know
immediately where the message is stored when you reference the message in your
script file.</p>

<p>You can think of the message name as a constant. Once you have named an
individual message, you will most likely not modify the message content during
the execution of your scripts. When you reference your message from within a
script, you do not include the @ symbol. This symbol only tells JAWS that the
text immediately following the symbol is the actual name of the message. For
example, if you have messages defined in your message file as @Msg1 and @Msg2,
you would reference those messages using the Say function as follows:</p>

<p class="Code">Say (Msg1, OT_MESSAGE)<br>
Say (Msg2, OT_MESSAGE)</p>

<p>In the above examples, only the actual message name is used as the parameter
for the Say function. </p>

<h2>The Body of the Message</h2>

<p>The text to be spoken by JAWS immediately follows the @MsgName statement.
This is the body of the individual message. The body of the message can contain
any text or punctuation. You can type anything inside the body of the message
that you would in a word processor or text editor. You can press <b>ENTER</b>
to create a new line and do not have to use escape characters to represent
certain symbols such as the backslash. The following example shows the message
name and the text contained in the body of a message:</p>

<p class="Code">@MsgName<br>
This text is part of the body of a message. Notice it is written
just as if you typed it into a text editor or word processor. When you press
the keystroke to activate the script that uses this message, JAWS speaks this
text.</p>

<h2>Message Placeholders</h2>

<p>You can also use placeholders within the body of your message. These
placeholders essentially hold a place in your message for information you want
to add to the message during the execution of your script or function. You can
use up to nine placeholders within the body of the message. To add a
placeholder to your message, type the percent sign followed by a number from 1
to 9.</p>

<p>You can find the following examples of the use of placeholders in the
common.jsm message file:</p>

<p class="Code">;for cMsgMenuItem_L/S, %1=app title, %2=current menu selection,
this is used in SayWindowTitle<br>
@cMsgMenuItem_L<br>
title= %1 menu<br>
%2<br>
@@<br>
@cMsgMenuItem_S<br>
%1<br>
menu<br>
%2<br>
@@</p>

<p>The message referenced by MsgMenuItem_L shown above is heard when you press <b>INSERT+T</b>
to read the title of an application and a menu is open. The placeholders allow
for changes in the menu name and the selected item in the menu. This message is
heard when you are using beginner verbosity. The message referenced by
MsgMenuItem_S is heard when you are using intermediate or advanced verbosity.</p>

<h2>Ending the Message</h2>

<p>After you have completed the body of the message, you need to end the
individual message. You type 2 @ symbols &quot;@@&quot; to tell JAWS that this
is the end of your individual message. You should type the @ symbols together
without spaces between them. The @@ symbols should go on their own line
following the individual message.</p>

<p>The following example shows a complete individual message:</p>

<p class="Code">@MsgName<br>
This text is part of the body of a message. Notice it is written
just as if you typed it into a text editor or word processor. When you press
the keystroke to activate the script that uses this message, JAWS speaks this
text.<br>
@@</p>

<h2>Ending the Messages Block</h2>

<p>After you have entered all of your messages into your message file, you must
end the messages block. The key word EndMessages tells JAWS this is the end of
all of your messages. You only type this key word once in your message file. It
must follow all individual messages. There is no space separating the words of
&quot;End&quot; and &quot;Messages.&quot; The following example shows a complete
messages block:</p>

<p class="Code">Messages<br>
@MsgName<br>
This text is part of the body of a message. Notice it is written
just as if you typed it into a text editor or word processor. When you press
the keystroke to activate the script that uses this message, JAWS speaks this
text.<br>
@@<br>
EndMessages</p>

<h2>Adding Comments</h2>

<p>You can add comments at the top of your message file or within the messages
block. Just as in your script file, you begin all comments with a &quot;;&quot;
semi colon. When you add comments inside the messages block, make sure you have
not added the comments in the body of an individual message. Even though you
begin a comment line with a semi colon, JAWS will think it is just part of the
body of your message. Thus, the comment will be treated just as if it is part
of the message.</p>

<p>An example of comments within a script message file along with an message
block follows:</p>

<h3>Example 1: Full Message Block Example</h3>

<p class="Code">; JAWS 12.0.512 Message file for Notepad in Windows
Vista<br>
; created by the Freedom Scientific Training Department<br>
Messages<br>
; my first practice message<br>
@MsgName<br>
This text is part of the body of a message. Notice it is written
just as if you typed it into a text editor or word processor. When you press the
keystroke to activate the script that uses this message, JAWS speaks this text.<br>
@@<br>
EndMessages</p>

<p>In the above example, the comment within the message block is placed before
the start of the individual message.</p>
