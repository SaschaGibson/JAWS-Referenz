# General Scripting Concepts

The Freedom Scientific Developer network (FSDN) is a set of help files
intended to be used as a reference for the Freedom Scientific Scripting
language and API tools. It is not a scripting manual or training tool.
Furthermore, it is assumed that you have knowledge of basic programming
concepts like statement and logic structures, the meaning of terms such
as \"variable\", \"constant\", or \"function\", etc. Therefore, such
terms are not explained.

Since the FSDN is meant to be used as a reference, you may choose to
read any topic of interest in any order because book summaries are
designed to be self-contained wherever possible; that is, they are
independent of each other with links to relevant topics where
appropriate. Plus, many book summaries and subtopics include code
samples you may find helpful.

The FSDN is divided into three major sections:

- General Scripting Concepts
- Reference Guide
- API Tools, including FS Braille Display API

The General Scripting Concepts book contains numerous general topic
summaries as well as function descriptions. Where possible, general
topic summaries point to related topics. Many topic summaries include
code samples to facilitate understanding of how to apply certain
concepts to scripts and functions for JAWS features (i.e., Split
Braille). There are new general topic areas and ones already familiar to
you but with updated content. The general topic areas are updated each
time the FSDN is published.

The Reference Guide is comprised of many category books of scripts and
functions. Each category book of scripts and functions has a summary,
and each script or function is listed with specific details of its own.
The number of categories is updated with new summary pages for new
features. And the existing category summaries are updated each time the
FSDN is published. So it may be worth checking them out even if they are
already familiar. Plus, there are likely new scripts and functions
available for your use than the last time you examined a particular
category.

The API Tools book is specifically for very advanced users familiar with
the concepts of API functionality. One set of tools for example is the
FS Braille Display API book, which contains functions related to the
Freedom Scientific Braille displays. The API Tools book also contains:

- FSAPI: a tool that allows you to obtain object model information for
  third-party applications through the COM process.\
  [FSAPI](#FSAPI){#li_FSAPI}
- Research It Lookup Module API: a tool so you can create your own
  customized rule sets for third-party applications.\
  [Research It DLL
  API](#Research%20It%20Dll%20API){#li_Research It DLL API}

## Scripting Language Enhancements

As mentioned above, every new version of JAWS introduces new scripts and
functions to enhance the flexibility of JAWS and to further your ability
to customize it for your needs. The Freedom Scientific Scripting
language has added many critical enhancements. See the list of most
recent to oldest features and enhancements in the\
[]{#What's New} [What\'s New](What's_New.html) page at the top of the
tree for the FSDN.

## Book Topics

The following topics are included in the FSDN General Scripting Concepts
book, the API Tools book, and the Reference Guide. Check to see which
ones are updated since the last published FSDN. Many of these topics
have their own summaries within the topic areas, as well. For example,
there are new categories in the Reference Guide. The topics include:\
