# Settings Events

A Settings event function provides information about settings changes
that occur automatically as applications are loaded and unloaded, or
settings changes that occur by user interaction with the screen
reader\'s user interface. JAWS uses this information to determine
whether to speak and display something, depending on a setting change or
a script configuration change. In this case, to display information
refers to showing it in Braille.

Numerous scripts are assigned for handling settings changes through the
Settings Center and Quick Settings user interface in JAWS.

Starting with JAWS 15, an example of a Settings event function is
ConfigurationChangedEvent. For a complete listing of functions related
to Settings events, see the category books in the Reference Guide called
Settings Events and also [Settings.](../Reference_Guide/Settings.html)
