# Aggregate Data Types Functions

JAWS supports collections and arrays as data types. Collections and
arrays are called aggregate data types because each collection or array
is a single entity which is capable of holding multiple pieces of data.

For a complete listing of functions that can be used with collections or
arrays, see the topics in this category book of the Reference Guide
