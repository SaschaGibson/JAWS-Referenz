# 2.0 The Keyboard Manager

You control the assignment of keystrokes to JAWS commands using the
Keyboard Manager. The Keyboard Manager stores keystroke assignments in
key map files, which have the extension of .jkm. You usually assign
keystrokes to scripts at the time the script is created using the Script
Manager. You can use the Keyboard Manager to view, add, change, or
delete keystroke assignments.

The Keyboard Manager has a screen layout that consists of a left hand
pane and a right hand pane. Press **TAB** and **SHIFT+TAB** to move
between the two panes. Press **UP** and **DOWN** **ARROW** to move up
and down either side of the manager.

For a list of all keyboard commands available in the Keyboard Manager,
see [Appendix B: Keyboard Manager Commands](Appendix_B.htm).
