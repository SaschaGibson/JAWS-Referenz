<h1>7.0 Using Variables and Constants</h1>

<p>In previous chapters, you created scripts that spoke messages using hard
coded strings of text. You used the SayString and Say built-in functions to
speak those strings of text by typing the text directly into the parentheses of
the function. You had to surround the text with quotation marks because each
function expected a string of text as its parameter.</p>

<p>Instead of using numeric values to represent the output type in the Say
function, you used constants to represent those values. You can find all of the
output type constants in the default constant file, HJConst.jsh. </p>

<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to declare and use variables. You will
learn the differences between local and global variables as well. You will also
learn how to declare your own constant values and then use them in your
scripts.</p>
