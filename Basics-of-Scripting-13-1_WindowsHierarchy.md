# 13.1 Windows Hierarchy

The operating system does not randomly place the various windows that
may be present on your screen at any one time. They are interrelated
with a special hierarchy that allows the Windows operating system and
the programmers who work within it to keep track of each window.

You can think of these inter-relationships as one of parents and
children. The desktop is the parent of all application windows. Thus,
the JAWS window, your word processor\'s window and the Internet
browser\'s window are all children of the desktop. These windows are all
one level down from the desktop, which makes them all children of the
desktop at the same logical level. It also means that all of them are
peers of each other. When you later encounter terms such as PriorWindow
and NextWindow, the reference is to moving among peer windows at the
same logical level.

The word processor window has several child windows, the text area, the
menu bar, the toolbar and the status line. These are all children of the
word processor window and are all children at the same logical level.
When you press the keystroke to open a file in your word processor, the
word processor displays a child window that prompts you for the file to
open. This window is often referred to as a dialog box, but it is a
child window to the word processor, its parent.

If you think of the Open File dialog box as a parent then you will find
that the File Name edit box and all other controls are children of the
open file dialog box. These are all children of the parent dialog and
are at the same logical level. Each window is a child to the window one
level up that spawned or generated it, and each window is a parent to
the windows one level down from it.

You can find a good analogy of the parent-child relationship by using
the file folder structure of your PC. On your disk drive, the C:\\ drive
is typically the parent of all other folders on your drive. All of the
subfolders one level down from C:\\ are children of that parent and are
at the same logical level. Thus, if you have subfolders named Documents
and Settings, Program Files and Windows on your system, they are all one
level down from C:\\. They are all children of C:\\ and are all one
logical level down. For the purposes of folder tree structure and window
hierarchy, you can assume that being at the same logical level means
that all windows were spawned or generated by the same parent.

When you open the Program Files subfolder, you should find subfolders
such as Common Files, Freedom Scientific and Internet Explorer. These
three subfolders are all one level down from Program Files, are children
of Program Files, and are at the same logical level as each other, two
levels down from C:\\. This can continue until the lowest logical level
of a particular branch is reached.

The parent/child structure of Windows works much the same way as a
folder structure. Each application is a branch of the tree, and child
windows are spawned from it. All windows one level down from the parent
application are children at the same logical level. Each of these
children can spawn children of their own, and these children are three
levels down from the parent application.

Another example of a parent child relationship is the world we live in.
Think of your house as being at the bottom end of a hierarchy. The
parent of your house is the city you live in. All the other houses in
your city are children of your city and are at the same logical level.
For example, all the houses in St. Petersburg are at the same logical
level. They all have the same parent which is the city of St.
Petersburg. The parent of your city is the state you live in. Every city
is at the same logical level and has the same parent. The parent of St.
Petersburg is the state of Florida. All the cities in Florida are at the
same logical level and have the same parent. The parent of each state is
your country. Every state is at the same logical level and is a child of
its country. The parent of Florida is the United States. All the states
in the US are at the same logical level and have the same parent. You
can think of the planet itself as being the parent of all the countries.
As you can see, the hierarchy can contain many different levels.

## Identifying Windows

An application programmer assigns a number of identifiers to each
window. These identifiers allow the window to be referred to
individually. Each window has a class, type, type code, window subtype
code, and control ID. These window categories are important because JAWS
behaves differently, depending on what category of window is active.

For example, if an edit field is active, JAWS tracks the insertion
point. If you press DOWN ARROW, JAWS speaks the line of text to which
the insertion point moves. When a list box or menu is active, JAWS
tracks the highlight or lightbar as the arrow keys are used to move it
up and down the list. JAWS knows to do these things because of the
scripts that are associated with the up and down arrow keys in the
default script file. These scripts contain logic that decides what to do
based on the type of window that has the focus when one of these keys is
used.

## The Window Handle

The window handle is a unique number assigned by the operating system to
each window when it is created during a given session. Window handles
change each time the window is created. However, the handle value
remains constant as long as the window exists.

As long as a window exists, you can use the handle to refer to and
identify that window. But when a window is closed, it relinquishes its
handle. If the window is created later, the operating system assigns a
different handle.

You can retrieve the window handle using the built-in functions,
GetCurrentWindow and GetFocus. There is a distinct difference between
these two functions. The GetFocus function retrieves the handle of the
window that contains the insertion point or system focus. The
GetCurrentWindow function retrieves the handle of the window containing
the active cursor. Many of the JAWS functions used to manipulate windows
use the window handle as a parameter. You can use the GetFocus and
GetCurrentWindow functions as parameters to other window related
functions. An example of how the GetFocus function is used follows:

### Example 1: Using the GetFocus Function

Script GetWindowFocus ()\
var\
handle hFocusWindow\
let hFocusWindow = GetFocus ()\
; the GetFocus statement could be replaced by the following line:\
; let hFocusWindow = GetCurrentWindow ()\
SayInteger (hFocusWindow); speak the value of the window handle\
EndScript

## Window Class

The window class is a string of text that denotes some information about
a window and what it does. A window class can be an edit field, list
box, or a button. It provides valuable information about the window.
However, the window class does not always provide specific information.
Checking the window class will return the same information for a button,
radio button, and checkbox all of which have a Window Class of button.
JAWS recognizes 30 different classes.

Many times, programmers use custom window classes that JAWS cannot
recognize. In these cases, you must tell JAWS how to treat the
unrecognized class. After you tell JAWS how to treat a custom window
class, JAWS reacts to the window class just as if it were a recognized
window class. You can retrieve the Window Class with the function,
GetWindowClass. An example of how the window class is retrieved follows:

### Example 2: Using the GetWindowClass Function

Script RetrieveWindowClass\
var\
string sTheClass\
let sTheClass = GetWindowClass (GetFocus ())\
If sTheClass == "Edit" Then ; the window class is an edit box\
Say (\"Focus is in an edit box.\" OT_MESSAGE)\
Else\
Say (\"The focus is not in an edit box.\", OT_MESSAGE) ;the window class
is something other than Edit\
EndIf\
EndScript

## Window Type

The window type is a string of text that describes the window.
Occasionally, the window type reveals more specific information about
certain windows. The window type and window class are the same if no
more specific information is available. For example, the window class
and window type of an edit box are exactly the same.

You can use the window type to differentiate between a checkbox and a
radio button. You use the function GetWindowType to retrieve the Window
Type. The GetWindowType function returns the string of \"unknown window
type\" when the application programmer used a custom window class to
define the window. The Window Type is always in English and is not very
useful for those using JAWS in other languages. An example of how the
GetWindowType function is used follows:

### Example 3: Using the GetWindowType Function

Script RetrieveWindowType ()\
Var\
string sTheType\
Let sTheType = GetWindowType (GetFocus ())\
If sTheType == \"Edit\" Then ; the window type returned is an edit box\
Say (\"The focus is in an edit box\", OT_MESSAGE)\
Else\
Say (\"The focus is not in an edit box.\", OT_MESSAGE) ; a window type
other than edit was found\
EndIf\
EndScript

## Window Type Code

The window type code is a numeric value instead of a string. This number
is translated into a recognizable string by constant definitions found
in the file, HJConst.jsh. For example, in this file you can find lines
such as WT_BUTTON=1, WT_COMBOBOX=2, WT_EDIT=3, WT_LISTBOX=4, and
WT_SCROLLBAR=5. The WT prefix of the constant indicates that this is a
constant that refers to a window type code.

While the window type code does not provide any more information than
the window type, it does have the advantage of being language
independent. You retrieve the window type code with the function,
GetWindowTypeCode. An example of how the GetWindowTypeCode function is
used follows:

### Example 4: Using the GetWindowTypeCode Function

Script RetrieveWindowTypeCode ()

Var

int iTheTypeCode

Let iTheTypeCode = GetWindowTypeCode (GetFocus ())

If iTheTypeCode == WT_Edit Then

; the window type code of 3 was found. The constant, WT_Edit

; is defined in HJConst.jsh and given a value of 3.

Say ("The focus is in an edit box.", OT_MESSAGE)

Else

Say (\"The focus is not in an edit box.\", OT_MESSAGE)

; a window type code other than 3 was found, so focus is not in an edit
box

EndIf

EndScript

## Window Subtype Code

Like the window type code, the window subtype code is also a numeric
value. However, the window subtype code may provide more detailed
information. If no subtype code is available for the window, then the
window type code and window subtype code are identical. You should use
the window sub type code as it generally provides more specific
information about a window than does the window type code. You can use
the same constant definitions to refer to window subtype codes as you
can for window type codes in your scripts and functions. For example, a
radio button has a window type code of 1 (WT_Button) but a subtype code
of 19 (WT_RadioButton). Window subtype codes are also language
independent. You use the function, GetWindowSubTypeCode, to retrieve the
window subtype code for a given window. An example of the use of the
GetWindowSubTypeCode function follows:

### Example 5: Using the GetWindowSubTypeCode Function

Script RetrieveWindowSubTypeCode ()

Var

int iTheSubTypeCode,

int iTheTypeCode

let iTheTypeCode = GetWindowTypeCode (GetFocus ())

let iTheSubTypeCode = GetWindowSubTypeCode (GetFocus ())

If iTheTypeCode == WT_Button Then

If iTheSubTypeCode == WT_RadioButton Then

; the window type code of 1 was retrieved. The constant, WT_Button, is
defined in HJConst.jsh and

; given the value of 1.

; the next If-Then statement checks for a subtype code of 19. The
constant, WT_radiobutton is

; given the value of 19 in the HJConst.jsh file.

Say (\"The active window is a radio button.\" OT_MESSAGE)

Else

Say (\"The active window is not a radio button.\" OT_MESSAGE)

EndIf

Else

Say (\"The active window is not a button.\" OT_MESSAGE)

EndIf

EndScript

## Window Control ID

The control ID is a number assigned by the programmer to each window
during application development. The control ID, unlike the window class,
has no special meaning, but you can use it to refer to a particular
window.

One example where the use of control ID's are extremely useful is in
applications where the buttons are labeled with bit map images instead
of text labels. Normally, JAWS speaks the text label of a button when
you move to it. If the label is a drawing, there is no name to be
spoken. By determining the control ID numbers of the various bit map
buttons, you can write a script that speaks the name of the button when
the focus moves to it.

In most cases, the control ID is defined during application development
and can be relied upon to uniquely identify a specific window. However,
you may find cases where control ID's have not been assigned by the
application developer. In these cases, you will find that each window in
a given application has a control ID value of 0. You must then rely on
other window identifiers along with the window's hierarchical position
to uniquely identify it.

You may also find that the control ID's in a given application are
dynamically assigned. This means that each time an application window or
any of it's child windows are created, the control ID's are assigned and
do not remain constant. In these cases, you will find that you need to
use the other windows identifiers and the window hierarchical position
to uniquely identify the window.

You can determine if control ID's are dynamically assigned by running
the application, noting the control ID values of some of it's child
windows, then restarting the application and looking at those same
control ID values. If they have changed, then you will know that the
ID's are dynamically assigned. You use the function, GetControlID, to
retrieve the control ID for a given window. An example of how the
GetControlID function is used follows:

### Example 6: Using the GetControlID Function

Script IdentifyWindow ()\
Var\
int iControlID\
let iControlID = GetControlID (GetFocus ())\
If iControlID == 1100 Then; look for a specific control ID\
Say (\"This is the file name edit box\", OT_MESSAGE)\
; the file name edit box has a control ID of 1100\
Else\
Say (\"This is not the file name edit box.\", OT_MESSAGE)\
EndIf\
EndScript
