<h1>5.1 Before You Start</h1>

<p>Before you start writing scripts, there are a few things you should add to
your new script file. You can add comments at the beginning of the file to
document the script file. Comments make it easier to maintain the scripts and
user-defined functions contained in your script files. You can also use include
statements. An include statement tells JAWS to take the contents of one file
and add it to your script file. You usually include script header and message
files.</p>

<h2>Adding Comments</h2>

<p>You can add comments anywhere within your script file. You begin a comment
with a semicolon (;). When JAWS encounters a semicolon, the compiler ignores
anything to the right on the line on which the semicolon appears. You can use
comments to give information about the script file, describe complex script
statements, and more. Some examples of comments follow:</p>

<p class="Code">
; script file for Notepad<br>
SayString ("Hello world!"); Speak a message<br>
; SayString ("Hello world!") tell the compiler to ignore this entire line</p>

<p>When you use multiple lines for comments, you must place a semicolon at the
beginning of each line. Otherwise, you will encounter syntax errors when you
try to compile your script file.</p>

<p>When you begin with a blank file, it is a good idea to start the file off
with a comment section. You can use this comment section to document any
information about the application being scripted, version of JAWS, and date you
created the file. An example of a comment block follows:</p>

<p class="Code">
; Script file for Notepad in Windows Vista <br>
; written for JAWS version 12.0.XXX<br>
; Written by the Freedom Scientific Training Department December 2010</p>

<h2><a name=include></a>The Include Statement</h2>

<p>After you have created a comment block at the top of your new script file,
you can add one or more include statements. The Include statement tells JAWS to
include the entire contents of a file in the script file at the time you
compile the file. You can think of an include statement as a way of putting a
large amount of information into your script file without having to actually
type it.</p>

<p>By using the include statement, you can store all of your messages used in
your script files in one location. Then you can use the include statement in
each script file that will use those messages. If you ever need to make a
change to a message, you need only make the change in the message file. Since
it is included in each script file, you make the change in only one place.
After you have made the change, you can compile each script file to include
your changes. </p>

<p>You can also store all of your global variable and constant declarations in
a script header file. You can then use the include statement in multiple script
files and use the global variables and constants in each of those files. When
you need to make a change to a constant value, for example, you need only make
it one place. After you make the change, you just compile each of the script
files that use the particular script header file. This makes changing a
constant value much easier because you need not make the change in several
places.</p>

<p>You begin the include statement with the word "include," without
the quotation marks. Following the word "include" is the file name to
be included. The file name must be enclosed in quotation marks. The file name
must also include the file extension. You can include both script header and
script message files. Each included file must be located in your JAWS settings
directory. </p>

<p>Examples of the include statement follow:</p>

<p class="Code">
include "hjconst.jsh"; default constant file<br>
include "hjglobal.jsh"; default global file<br>
include "common.jsm"; message file </p>
