 <H1>8.0 Creating and Speaking Messages</H1>

<P>In this chapter, you will learn how to create messages using the JAWS message
  format. You will learn how to create your messages within a JAWS script message,
  (.jsm) file. You will also learn how to use long and short messages to honor
  your verbosity settings.</P>
<P>In the previous chapters, you created scripts using built-in speaking functions
  that used hard-coded messages. A hard-coded message is a string of text typed
  directly in a function as a parameter. </P>
<P>Each time you need to change the contents of the message, you must search the
  entire file for the message. Once you have located the message, you have to
  modify the message being careful not to forget the quotation marks surrounding
  the message. You have to do this with each message contained in your script
  file.</P>
<P>Rather than using hard-coded messages, you can store all of your messages in
  a JAWS script message file (.jsm). This makes it easier to find all of your
  messages as they are all in one place. If you ever need to modify one or more
  of the messages, you need only to go to the message file and make the change
  once. You can include your message in any number of script files using the include
  statement.</P>
<P>When you make changes to any of the messages in your message file, you must
  recompile each script file that includes the message file. You must take this
  extra step so that JAWS sees the changes to your messages.</P>
