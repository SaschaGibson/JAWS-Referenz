 <H1>6.0 Reading Information with Scripts</H1>
 
<P>You learned about the Script Manager and used it to create your first two scripts 
  in <a href="04-0_TheScriptManager.htm">Chapter 4</a> and <a href="05-0_CreatingScripts.htm">Chapter 
  5</a>. You created scripts that simply spoke messages when you pressed the appropriate 
  keystroke.</P>
<P>In this chapter, you will learn how to use the scripting language to read areas 
  of the screen by moving various cursors. As you create scripts that read parts 
  of a window, you should understand the differences between the various cursors 
  and how they can be manipulated through a script or function.</P>
<P>JAWS has three cursors you can use to read areas of the screen: </P>
<ul>
  <li>PC cursor</li>
  <li>JAWS cursor</li>
  <li>Invisible cursor</li>
</ul>
<P>Manipulating cursors to read information is not the most efficient method of 
  accessing that information. However, as a beginning scripter, you can use cursor 
  manipulation as a quick way to write scripts to read information within a given 
  window. You do not need to know the relationship between windows or the types 
  of windows your scripts are accessing. As your knowledge of the scripting language 
  grows, you will learn how to create scripts that read information more efficiently 
  using advanced techniques.</P>
