# Script: WeatherWidget

## Description

The zip code format and data returned are all subject to the online
weather interface - not owned by Freedom Scientific. If Weather Widget
doesn\'t have a zip code stored, you will be prompted for your zip code
and asked if you want to save it. All weather conditions come from an
online weather interface and are presented in the Virtual Viewer. To use
a different zip code, use WeatherWidgetClearLocationInfo to reset your
location info and run Weather Widget again.
