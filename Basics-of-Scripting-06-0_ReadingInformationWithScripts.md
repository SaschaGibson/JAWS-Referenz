# 6.0 Reading Information with Scripts

You learned about the Script Manager and used it to create your first
two scripts in [Chapter 4](04-0_TheScriptManager.htm) and [Chapter
5](05-0_CreatingScripts.htm). You created scripts that simply spoke
messages when you pressed the appropriate keystroke.

In this chapter, you will learn how to use the scripting language to
read areas of the screen by moving various cursors. As you create
scripts that read parts of a window, you should understand the
differences between the various cursors and how they can be manipulated
through a script or function.

JAWS has three cursors you can use to read areas of the screen:

- PC cursor
- JAWS cursor
- Invisible cursor

Manipulating cursors to read information is not the most efficient
method of accessing that information. However, as a beginning scripter,
you can use cursor manipulation as a quick way to write scripts to read
information within a given window. You do not need to know the
relationship between windows or the types of windows your scripts are
accessing. As your knowledge of the scripting language grows, you will
learn how to create scripts that read information more efficiently using
advanced techniques.
