# 6.4 Invisible Cursor

The Invisible cursor was created for the sole purpose of accessing
information on the screen. You have probably not used the Invisible
cursor during your daily use of JAWS. The Invisible cursor is identical
to the JAWS cursor. You can move it anywhere on the screen, but you
cannot perform any mouse actions such as a left mouse click.

You use the same navigation keystrokes as you do when other cursors are
active. You can activate the Invisible cursor from your keyboard by
pressing **NUM PAD MINUS** twice in succession. When you only need to
read information on the screen, then the Invisible cursor is the best
cursor to use.

## Activating the Invisible Cursor

You can use the built-in function, InvisibleCursor to activate the
Invisible cursor regardless of its location on your screen. The
InvisibleCursor function activates the cursor just like using **NUM PAD
MINUS** twice from your keyboard.
