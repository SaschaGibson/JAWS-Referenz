# Face in View

The Face in View feature allows you to get information telling you
whether your face is centered in the camera\'s view, as well as whether
your face is angled towards or away from the camera. It can also tell
you about the lighting level of the room, and use Picture Smart to
report on what is in the camera\'s view.

The scripts in this category are default scripts to turn Face in View on
or off, to set the confidence level, to run Picture Smart on the image,
to announce the brightness level, and to get a more detailed description
of the face location.

FaceInViewFunc.jss source file, which works with default.jss, contains
code for JAWS to control how Face in View works, as well as what JAWS
speaks for the feature. To see or modify the scripts that support Face
in View, refer to this source file. For a complete listing of builtin
script functions for use with Face in View, see the topics in this
category book of the Reference Guide.
