 <H1>6.5 Before You Move a Cursor</H1>
 
<P>After you activate a cursor you should save its location. This ensures that 
  the cursor is restored to the correct position on the screen after your script 
  is performed. For example, when you are using the JAWS cursor to access a specific 
  button within an application, you want it to stay there because you need to 
  perform a left mouse click. If you write a script that moves the JAWS cursor 
  without saving it first, then you must move the JAWS cursor back to the button 
  after your script is finished. The end result is that you are left with the 
  wrong cursor activated and in the wrong place.</P>
<P>You also need to route the cursor to the active application window. This action 
  ensures the cursor you are using to read specific information is in the correct 
  window. This is important as the JAWS and invisible cursors can be anywhere 
  on your screen. So it is always a good idea to move these cursors to the active 
  application. Otherwise, moving the cursor may yield unexpected results.</P>
<h2>Saving the Cursor</h2>
<P>You can use the SaveCursor built-in function to save the cursor and its location. 
  The SaveCursor function notes the active cursor and its present location. You 
  can call this function after activating any of the cursors such as the JAWS 
  cursor. The following block of code illustrates the use of the SaveCursor function:</P>

<P class="Code">
JAWSCursor (); activate the JAWS cursor<br>
SaveCursor (); save the JAWS cursor and its location</p>

<P>You can call the SaveCursor function multiple times in a script, after each 
  cursor you activate. This is called &quot;stacking saved cursors.&quot; The 
  following code example illustrates the use of multiple SaveCursor function calls:</P>

<P class="Code">
JAWSCursor () ; activate the JAWS cursor<br>
SaveCursor () ; save the JAWS cursor and its location<br>
InvisibleCursor () ; activate the invisible cursor<br>
SaveCursor () ; save the invisible cursor and its location</P>

<h2>Restoring Saved Cursors</h2>
<P>After you perform your script and JAWS finds one or more saved cursors, JAWS 
  restores them automatically. When you save multiple cursors, JAWS restores the 
  cursors in reverse order.</P>
<P>You can also use the RestoreCursor built-in function when you need to restore 
  a specific cursor before your script finishes. This function is useful when 
  you need to save a cursor first, perform an action with that cursor, and restore 
  it before the script finishes. </P>

<h3>Example 1: Using the RestoreCursor function</h3>

<P class="Code">PCCursor () ; activate the PC cursor<br>
SaveCursor () ; save the pc cursor<br>
JAWSCursor () ; activate the JAWS cursor<br>
SaveCursor () ; save the JAWS cursor<br>
; reading statements go here<br>
RestoreCursor (); restore the JAWS cursor</P>

<P>In the above example, the RestoreCursor function restores the last saved cursor. 
  In this case, the RestoreCursor function restores the JAWS cursor since it was 
  the last cursor saved.</P>
<h2>Routing the Cursors</h2>
<P>The PC cursor is generally the active cursor in most applications. When you 
  need to access information outside of the boundaries of the PC cursor, you need 
  to route either the JAWS or Invisible cursor to the location of the PC cursor. 
  When you route either cursor, you have a starting point that you know exists 
  within the active application.</P>
<h3>Routing the JAWS Cursor</h3>
<P>You can use the built-in function, RouteJAWSToPC to move the JAWS cursor to 
  the location of the PC cursor. This function repositions the JAWS cursor to 
  the exact position of the PC cursor. This function also moves the mouse pointer 
  to the location of the insertion point or selection highlight. </P>
<P>However, this function does not activate the JAWS cursor. Any cursor movement 
  functions used in your script will move the active cursor instead of the JAWS 
  cursor. If you want the JAWS cursor to move you must activate it first. </P>

<h4>Example 2: Using the RouteJAWSToPC function</h4>

<P class="Code">
JAWSCursor (); activate the JAWS cursor<br>
SaveCursor (); save the JAWS cursor and its location<br>
RouteJAWSToPC (); move the JAWS cursor to the location of the PC cursor</P>
<P>In the above example, the JAWS cursor is first activated and then saved. The 
  RouteJAWSToPC function moves the JAWS cursor from its current location to the 
  location of the PC cursor. At this point, you can use some of the cursor movement 
  functions to move the JAWS cursor. See <a href="06-6_MovingTheCursor.htm">6.6 
  Moving the Cursor</a> for more information on cursor movement functions. </P>
<h3>Routing the Invisible Cursor</h3>
<P>You can use the built-in function, RouteInvisibleToPC, to move the invisible 
  cursor to the location of the PC cursor. This function repositions the Invisible 
  cursor to the exact position of the PC cursor. Unlike the JAWS cursor, the Invisible 
  cursor is not connected to the mouse pointer, so the function does not move 
  the mouse pointer.</P>
<P>If you want to move the Invisible cursor you must also activate it first. </P>

<h4>Example 3: Using the RouteInvisibleToPC function</h4>

<P class="Code">
InvisibleCursor (); activate the Invisible cursor<br>
SaveCursor (); save the location of the invisible cursor<br>
RouteInvisibleToPC (); move the Invisible cursor to the PC cursor</P>
<P>In the above example, the Invisible cursor is activated then saved. The RouteInvisibleToPC 
  function then moves the Invisible cursor to the exact location of the PC cursor. 
  Now that the Invisible cursor is in the active window, you can use cursor movement 
  commands to read information contained within the window.</P>
