<h1>2.2 Keyboard Manager Files</h1>


<p>The Keyboard Manager uses two types of key map files: </p>

<ul>
<li>Default</li>
<li>Application</li>
</ul>

<p>All key map files have the file extension of .jkm.</p>

<p>The 'default' key map file contains the keystroke assignments for the
default script file. JAWS loads the default key map file into memory each time
you start JAWS. The default set of keystroke assignments are always available
for your use. </p>

<p>The 'application' key map files contain keystroke assignments for scripts in
an application script file. All application key map files have the same name as
the application's script file. For example, the script file name for Microsoft&reg;
Word 2007 is Microsoft Word 2007.jss. Thus, the key map file for Word is
Microsoft Word.jkm. See <a href="Appendix_D.htm">Naming JAWS
Settings Files</a> for more information on how JAWS derives the names of key
map files. </p>

<p>When you have an application plus the JAWS program open on your computer,
JAWS employs both the associated application key map file and the default key
map file so that both sets of keystroke assignments are available. </p>

<p>For those applications where the application and default key map files share
the same keystroke assignment, the keystroke assignment in the application key
map file always takes precedence over the keystroke assignment in the default
key map file. </p>
