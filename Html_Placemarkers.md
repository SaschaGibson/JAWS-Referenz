# HTML Placemarkers Functions

JAWS has the ability to define several placemarkers on a web page: one
temporary placemarker and up to four permanent ones.

You can use placemarkers to set a starting location for the virtual
cursor when the page loads, or to set a starting point for selecting
text. You can also use placemarkers to speak a specific line of the page
on demand, and to move the virtual cursor to the location of that text.

For a complete listing of Placemarkers scripts and functions, see the
topics in this category book of the Reference Guide.
