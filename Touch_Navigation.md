# Touch Navigation

Microsoft offers Touch Navigation as an alternative input method for you
to interact with the operating system and applications. Smart phones,
tablets, and many laptops and desktop monitors support touchable
surfaces that allow you to use gestures to control the operating system
and applications. So, Touch navigation is intended to give you the same
type of interaction capabilities on a desktop or laptop that you have on
your smart phone and tablet.

A Touch Navigation script processes information about the application
BEING ACCESSED through Touch Navigation if the feature is enabled on the
device and also enabled in JAWS.

As of JAWS 15, you may elect to enable Touch navigation for certain
applications where it is preferable to keyboard interaction, or where
Touch Navigation is the only input method available.

JAWS provides numerous scripts assigned to various types of gestures
instead of keystroke combinations to mimic Touch Navigation interaction
with the operating system or with a particular application. Gestures are
defined as a certain number of fingers plus the gesture. For example,
FourFingers+TripleTap is for KeyboardHelp, and TwoFingers+FlickDown is
for TouchSayAll. The types of gestures that JAWS supports include:

- Tap
- DoubleTap
- TripleTap
- FlickUp
- FlickDown
- FlickRight
- FlickLeft
- FlickSwipeRight
- FlickSwipeLeft
- FlickSwipeUp
- FlickSwipeDown
- Tap+Explore
- Tap+ExploreEnd

Some examples of Touch Navigation scripts include:

- AdvancedObjectNavigationModeToggle
- TouchCloseApp
- TouchNextElement
- TouchPriorElement
- TouchStopCurrentSpeechOutput
