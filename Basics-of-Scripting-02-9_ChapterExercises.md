# 2.9 Chapter Exercises

The following exercises give you practice in using many of the functions
of the Keyboard Manager. The objective of the exercise is listed first.

## Exercise 2.1: Finding a Keystroke

The objective of this exercise is to find a specific keystroke within
the default key map file and view the corresponding script
documentation.

1.  Press **INSERT+F2** to display the Run JAWS Managers dialog.
2.  Type **K** to select the Keyboard Manager option followed by
    **ENTER**. This action starts the Keyboard Manager.
3.  Press **INSERT+UP ARROW** to read the current line. This is the
    current key map file. Did the selected key map file match the active
    application?
4.  Press **CTRL+SHIFT+D** to select the default key map file. The
    contents of the file are shown in the right hand pane of the
    Keyboard Manager.
5.  Press **TAB** to move to the right hand pane of the manager. How
    many items does JAWS tell you are contained in the list?
6.  Press **CTRL+F** to activate the Find Keystroke dialog.
7.  Press **INSERT+F12**. JAWS speaks the keystroke after you press it
    as **JAWS KEY+F12**. The keystroke is also shown in the Search for
    Key edit box.
8.  Press **ENTER** to begin the search. Did JAWS find the keystroke?
    Did JAWS read the script name, keystroke, key map file name and
    section? If you did not hear this information, press **INSERT+UP
    ARROW** to read the current line and repeat the information.
9.  Press **CTRL+D** to activate and display the Script Information
    dialog. Press **TAB** and **SHIFT+TAB** to move to and read the edit
    boxes contained in the dialog.
10. Press **ESCAPE** to close the dialog after you have reviewed the
    script information.

## Exercise 2.2: Adding a Keystroke

The objective of this exercise is to locate a specific keystroke in the
default key map file and add a second keystroke to the script attached
to that keystroke. If you already have the Keyboard Manager running, you
can move to it by pressing **ALT+TAB**. If the Keyboard Manager is not
running, then follow steps 1 through 3 in exercise 2.1 to start the
Keyboard Manager and open the default key map file.

1.  Press **CTRL+F** to activate the Find Keystroke dialog.
2.  Press **INSERT+F11**. This is the keystroke for which we want to
    search. JAWS echoes the keystroke as you press it and **JAWS
    KEY+F11**1 is placed in the Search for Key edit box.
3.  Press **ENTER** to begin the search. When JAWS finds the keystroke,
    the information is selected and spoken automatically by JAWS.

**Note:** If the keystroke was not found, then the Keystroke Not Found
dialog is displayed.

4.  Press **CTRL+A** to activate the Add Keystroke dialog. The Assign To
    edit box is active.
5.  Press **CTRL+F11**. JAWS echoes the keystroke and **CTRL+F11** is
    placed in the Assign To edit box.
6.  Press **TAB** to move to the Assign To X Keys Only check box where X
    represents the keyboard layout in use. If you are using the desktop
    layout then this is the Assign Key To Desktop Keys Only checkbox.
7.  Press **SPACEBAR** to uncheck the Assign Keys to X check box.
8.  Press **ENTER** to activate the Ok button in the Add Keystroke
    dialog. Since the default button is the Ok button, the dialog is
    closed. Next, the Confirm Add Keystroke dialog is displayed.
9.  Press **SPACEBAR** to activate the Yes button. The Confirm Add
    Keystroke dialog is closed and you are returned to the Keyboard
    Manager.
10. Press **INSERT+UP ARROW** to read the current line. Did you hear the
    original keystroke information for **INSERT+F11** spoken by JAWS?
11. Press **DOWN ARROW** to move to the next entry in the list. Did you
    hear the new keystroke echoed by JAWS? If you want to repeat the
    information, press **INSERT+UP ARROW** to read the current line.

After you have completed the steps above, be sure to test both new and
old keystrokes. Do they both work?

## Exercise 2.3: Changing an Existing Keystroke

The objective of this exercise is to locate the keystroke we just added
in the previous exercise and change it. You should still have the
Keyboard Manager running with the default key map file open. If you
closed the Keyboard Manager, follow steps 1 through 3 from exercise 2.1
to activate the Keyboard Manager and open the default key map file.

1.  Press **CTRL+F** to activate the Find Keystroke dialog. The focus is
    in the Search for Key edit box.
2.  Press **CTRL+F11**. This is the keystroke for which the search is
    carried out. JAWS speaks the keystroke and **CTRL+F11** is displayed
    in the Search for Key edit box.
3.  Press **ENTER** to activate the Ok button. The find keystroke action
    is performed. When the keystroke is found, the keystroke information
    is spoken automatically by JAWS.
4.  Press **CTRL+H** to activate the Change Keystroke dialog. The Assign
    To edit box is active in this dialog.
5.  Press **SHIFT+F11**. This is the new keystroke. JAWS echoes the
    keystroke and **SHIFT+F11** is placed in the assign To edit box.
6.  Press **TAB** to move to the Assign to X Keys Only check box, where
    X represents the keyboard layout in use. . If you are using the
    desktop layout, then this check box is labeled as Assign to Desktop
    Keys Only.
7.  Press **SPACEBAR** to uncheck the Assign to Desktop Keys Only
    checkbox.
8.  Press **ENTER** to activate the Ok button. The Change Keystroke
    dialog closes. The Confirm Change Keystroke dialog box is then
    displayed and the Yes button is active.
9.  Press **SPACEBAR** to activate the Yes button. The Confirm Change
    Keystroke dialog closes and you are returned to the Keyboard
    Manager.
10. Press **INSERT+UP ARROW** to read the current line. What keystroke
    information was spoken by JAWS?
11. Since the current keystroke entry is not the changed entry, press
    **UP ARROW** to move to the prior entry. Is this your new keystroke?

After you have followed the steps above, be sure to test both the old
and new keystrokes. Do they both work as expected?

## Exercise 2.4: Removing a Keystroke

The objective of this exercise is to find the keystroke we changed in
the previous exercise and remove it. This will leave only the original
keystroke to list the items in the system tray.

If the Keyboard Manager is not running already refer to steps 1 through
3 in exercise 2.1 to start the Keyboard Manager and open the default key
map file.

1.  Press **CTRL+F** to activate the Find Keystroke dialog. The Search
    for key edit box is active.
2.  Press **SHIFT+F11**. This is the keystroke for which the search is
    carried out. JAWS echoes the keystroke and **SHIFT+F11** is placed
    in the Search for Key edit box.
3.  Press **ENTER** to perform the Find Keystroke action. When the
    keystroke is found, the information is highlighted and spoken
    automatically by JAWS.
4.  Press **DELETE** to remove the keystroke. The Remove Keystroke
    dialog is displayed and the Yes button is active.
5.  Press **SPACEBAR** to activate the Yes button and close the Confirm
    Remove Keystroke dialog. The keystroke is removed from the default
    key map file.
6.  Press **INSERT+UP ARROW** to read the current line. Is the
    **SHIFT+F11** keystroke gone? Is the default keystroke,
    **INSERT+F11**, the only keystroke displayed?
