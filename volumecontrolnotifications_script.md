# Script: VolumeControlNotifications

## Description

In newer versions of Windows 10, Windows sends accessible notifications
when you press buttons on your multimedia keyboard, smart speaker,
external sound device or headphones. We speak many accessible event
notifications when the Enable Accessible Notification Events checkbox is
checked in Settings Center. This keystroke lets you control announcement
of volume control notifications from these devices. Changes to this
setting stay in effect for all applications and between JAWS sessions.
Enable Accessible Notification Events must be turned on before you can
control this setting.
