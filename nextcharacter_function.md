# Function: NextCharacter

## Description

This performs a special version of the RIGHT ARROW or Next Character
keyboard command. When the PC cursor is active, JAWS allows the
application to move the cursor. When other cursors are active, then JAWS
tries to move the cursor to the next character or graphic it finds to
the right of the current cursor location. To speak the character at the
new location, place a SayCharacter function after the NextCharacter
function. Note: Once the cursor has moved to the next character, it is
not spoken.
