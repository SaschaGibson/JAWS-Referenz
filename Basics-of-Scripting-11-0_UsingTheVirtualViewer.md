# 11.0 Using the Virtual Viewer

When you press **INSERT+H** or **INSERT+W** to display hot key help,
JAWS displays the keystrokes within the virtual viewer. Likewise, when
you press **INSERT+F1** to review screen sensitive help, JAWS displays
the information in the virtual viewer as well.

When JAWS displays information in the virtual viewer, the virtual cursor
is active. You can use normal navigation keystrokes to read, select, and
copy selected text to the clipboard.

The virtual viewer is a Virtual Buffer you create using the Scripting
Language and is a part of JAWS. The virtual viewer is also known as the
user buffer. Text displayed in the virtual viewer is black on a white
background, has a font size of 12 and a font type of Arial. The text
displayed in the virtual viewer is identical to text found in any word
processor or text editor.

In this chapter, you will learn how to display messages in the virtual
viewer. You will also learn how to create keystroke links within the
virtual viewer.
