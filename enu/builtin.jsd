When the optional second argument is TRUE, the object will be released in a way that there is no chance of the Release call blocking, even if the Release involves calling into another process that isn't responsive. When set to FALSE, the second parameter means set the object to null, releasing the pointer in JAWS.  In other words, if the argument references an IDispatch object, that object will be released. The second parameter is set to TRUE by default. This added functionality is less resource efficient and should only be used in those situations where the call is likely to block.
:Returns int TRUE if the object has been release, FALSE otherwise.
:Param Object/obj The object to release
:Optional

:Description Reads an integer value from an ini style file or one of the transient settings files for the specified file.  An ini style file is a file containing sections of keys with their values. The file that is read from is identified by the FileType parameter and an optional FileName parameter.  For some values of the FileType parameter, FT_CURRENT_JCF, FT_SHARED_CURRENT_JCF, and FT_JSI, for which a file name is required, the value returned by GetActiveConfiguration will be used if a file name is not provided via the FileName parameter. When FT_CURRENT_JCF is the file type, and no file name is supplied, the domain-specific file will be used if available.
:Returns int The retrieved value or the default value if the key does not exist in the given section. Before using the default value, the value from default.jcf will be checked first, if the file type is FT_CURRENT_JCF is used.

The module INI file is always located in the same directory in which the product is installed.  The FileName parameter is ignored for this file type. FT_DEFAULT_JCF: The file Default.JCF.  The FileName parameter is ignored for this file type.  When reading from this file, the settings stored in the Default.JCF file found in the user settings directory will be layered over the settings stored in the Default.JCF file found in the shared settings directory. FT_CURRENT_JCF: If available, the domain-specific jcf file. Otherwise, any application JCF file.  If the FileName parameter is not specified, the value returned by GetActiveConfiguration will be used.  When reading from this file, the settings stored in the JCF file found in the user settings directory will be layered over the settings stored in the JCF file found in the shared settings directory. FT_JSI: A JSI file.  If the FileName parameter is not specified, the name of the current application will be used. FT_SHARED_DEFAULT_JCF: The file Default.JCF found in the shared settings directory.  The FileName parameter is ignored for this file type.  When this file type is specified settings will only be read from the copy of the file found in the shared settings directory. FT_SHARED_CURRENT_JCF: Any application JCF file found in the shared settings directory.  If the FileName parameter is not specified, the value returned by GetActiveConfiguration will be used.  When this file type is specified settings will only be read from the copy of the file found in the shared settings directory.

:Param int/ReadSource One of the ReadSource (rs) constants defined in HJConst.JSH.  The possible values are as follows: rsStandardLayering - causes standard layering behavior to be used, the setting will be read from the transient focus file first, then the transient session file, then the user settings file, and finally the shared settings file, stopping at the first file in which the desired setting is found; rsSession - the setting will be read from the transient session settings file, no layering will be used; rsFocus - the setting will be read from the transient focus settings file, no layering will be used; rsNoTransient - the transient settings files will be ignored and the setting will be read from the user settings file layered over the shared settings file.  Note that this parameter is ignored if the FileType parameter is FT_MODULE_INI, FT_JSI, FT_SHARED_DEFAULT_JCF, or FT_SHARED_CURRENT_JCF.  If this parameter is not specified the default value of rsStandardLayering will be used.
:Param string/FileName  The name of file to read.  This value must either be a variable or contained in quotes.  It is unnecessary to specify the full path of the file, only the file name need be specified, since the file used will always be located in either the shared settings directory, the user settings directory, or the personalized settings directory.  The FileType parameter is used to determine in which directory the file will be searched for.  If this parameter is not specified and a file name is required for the specified file type, the value returned by GetActiveConfiguration will be used.

:Description The Run function is used as if you had entered its name and parameters in the Windows Run dialog. If the file name passed as an argument is the name of a program, then that program is run. If it is the name of a directory, then Windows Explorer is run to explore that directory. If the file is not a program but has an extension associated with a particular application, then that application is run to display the file. For example, passing changes.txt as the parameter to the Run function will open Notepad to edit the file changes.txt.
:Param string  This parameter must be either a text string enclosed in quotes, a variable name that contains a string value, or a script function that returns a string value. In any case, the string needs to be the name of the program you wish to run. It may be necessary to include a path and filename extension. To get the \ into the path name, you must actually use two \ characters. For example, write c:\\jfw32\\jframe.exe. This is very important. Failure to include two \ characters will cause the compiler to fail and jscript.exe to perform an illegal operation.

:Category Dialog Controls

:function SayControlEx
:Synopsis Handles the speaking of controls for which SayWindowTypeAndText and related functions do not sufficiently describe the control.
:Description This function is designed to be used in the script language to speak a control that requires custom processing (any control for which SayWindowTypeAndText does not properly speak the name and type of the control).  This function is designed to honor the user's output mode settings for each component of the control's description.  This function takes nine parameters, eight of which are string parameters.  The first parameter is the window handle of the control that is to be spoken. The next eight parameters include one parameter for each component of a control's description.  Each string parameter has a corresponding Output Mode.  The eight string parameters are String strControlName = Either OT_DIALOG_NAME, OT_DOCUMENT_NAME, or OT_CONTROL_NAME, depending on the type of window that is to be spoken, String strControlType = OT_CONTROL_TYPE, String strControlState = OT_ITEM_STATE, String strContainerName = OT_CONTROL_GROUP_NAME, String strContainerType = OT_CONTROL_TYPE, String strValue = OT_SELECTED_ITEM, String strPosition = OT_POSITION, String strDialogText = OT_DIALOG_TEXT. This function works by building a string based upon the five components of the control description, adding each component only if the user has specified that this item should speak in the current verbosity level.  Then this function calls Say with the constructed string as the first parameter and OT_NO_DISABLE as the second parameter. If any portion of the control description is not specified, JFW will obtain the default value for that component of the control description and will add the default value of that component to the control description string.  Therefore, if SayWindowTypeAndText speaks every part of a control correctly other than the Control Type, you can call SayControlEx and pass it the Window Handle and the text you would like to be spoken and pass a null string ("") to the function for the remainder of the parameters.  SayControlEx will obtain the default values for the control type, control st. ate, container name, container type, control value, control positional information, and the dialog text if the specified window is the top level window of a dialog box using the same methods as SayWindowTypeAndText and it will include these values in the control description string that is spoken.
:Returns Int Returns 1 if the function sucessfully assembled the control description string and spoke the control description (i.e. the length of the control description string was equal to 0).  If for some reason the function failed to assemble the control description string, the function returns 0.  One reason why this function would return 0 is that the user has specified that all the output modes be turned off in the current verbosity level.
:Param Handle/hwndControl	The window handle of the control.
:Optional
:Param String/strControlName	The name of the control.  This parameter is assigned an Output Mode of either OT_DIALOG_NAME, OT_DOCUMENT_NAME, or OT_CONTROL_NAME, depending on the type of window that is to be spoken.  If the window that is to be spoken has a window type of WT_DIALOG, this parameter is assigned an Output Mode of OT_DIALOG_NAME.  If the specified window is the App Main Window or Real Window, it is assigned an Output Mode of OT_DOCUMENT_NAME.  Otherwise it is assigned an Output Mode of OT_CONTROL_NAME.
:Param String/strControlType	The control type.  This parameter is assigned an Output Mode of OT_CONTROL_TYPE.
:Param String/strControlState	The control state.  This parameter is assigned an Output Mode of OT_ITEM_STATE.
:Param String/strContainerName  The name of the control container box.  For example, if this control is part of a group box, this paramater would be the name of the group box.  This parameter is assigned an Output Mode of OT_CONTROL_GROUP_NAME.
:Param String/strContainerType	The control type of the control container.  This parameter is assigned an Output Mode of OT_CONTROL_TYPE.  It is only spoken if the user has specified that both OT_CONTROL_GROUP_NAME and OT_CONTROL_TYPE are enabled.
:Param String/strValue	The current value of the control.  For example, if the specified control is a list box, the current value of the control is the text of the selected item in the list box.  This parameter is assigned an output mode of OT_SELECTED_ITEM.
:Param String/strPosition	Any relevant positional information for the control. For example if the specified control is a list box, the relevant positional information for the control is the index of the selected item in the list box. This parameter is assigned an output mode of OT_POSITION.
:Param String/strDialogText	If the specified control is the top level window of a dialog box, this parameter specifies the text that is to be spoken as the static text of the dialog box.  This parameter is assigned an output mode of OT_DIALOG_TEXT.

Note that this version of the function assumes that all parameters are using speech markup, ie they contain correct xml markup including symbol replacement (eg < with &lt; etc. This allows a control's type or state or value to be marked up to play sounds, change voice etc.
:Returns Int Returns 1 if the function successfully assembled the control description string and spoke the control description (i.e. the length of the control description string was equal to 0).  If for some reason the function failed to assemble the control description string, the function returns 0.

:function ScheduleFunctionAfterWindowGainsFocus
:Synopsis Schedules a function to run the next time a given window gains focus.
:Description This function may be used to schedule a function to run the next time a given window gains focus.  The function is scheduled using the same mechanism that is used by the ScheduleFunction function.  The ScheduleFunction function will be called to schedule the function specified by the FunctionName parameter the next time a Focus Changed Event occurs and the window handle of the window that just gained focus is the same as the window handle specified by the hwnd parameter.  Unlike the ScheduleFunction function, the value returned by the ScheduleFunctionAfterWindowGainsFocus is not an ID that can be used for a latter call to UnScheduleFunction.  Instead the value returned by this function indicates whether or not the function was scheduled successfully.  Currently there is no mechanism for un-scheduling a function that is scheduled using this function.  Another key difference between this function and the ScheduleFunction function is only one function can be scheduled at a time using this mechanism.  If ScheduleFunctionAfterWindowGainsFocus is called when a function that was previously scheduled using this function has not yet been called, the function will not be scheduled and this function will return FALSE. The function specified by the FunctionName parameter will be scheduled at the end of focus change event processing, after any necessary scripts have been loaded and the FocusChangedEvent function has been called.
:Returns int TRUE when the specified function was successfully scheduled.  FALSE otherwise.
:Param Handle/hwnd The window handle of the window to wait to gain focus before scheduling the function.
:Param String/FunctionName Name of function to be executed.
:Param Int/TimeOut Maximum amount of time, in milliseconds, that the function should wait before canceling the scheduled function.  Note that this script function returns immediately without waiting for the specified amount of time.  Instead, whenever a Focus Changed event is processed a check is performed to determine whether or not there is an unprocessed request to schedule a function after a given window gains focus.  If there is and the function has timed out, the scheduled function is canceled.
:Category Scripts

:function ScreenEcho

:function WriteSettingInteger
:Synopsis Writes an integer value to an ini style file.
:Description Writes an integer value to an ini style file.  An ini style file is a file containing sections of keys with their values. The file that is written to is identified by the FileType parameter and an optional FileName parameter.  For some values of the FileType parameter, FT_CURRENT_JCF and FT_JSI, for which a file name is required, the value returned by GetActiveConfiguration will be used if a file name is not provided via the FileName parameter. For FT_CURRENT_JCF, if a file name is not supplied, the domain-specific file will be used if available. Otherwise, the application's jcf file will be used.
:Returns int TRUE if successful, FALSE otherwise.
:Param string/sectionName The name of the section where the key and value will be written.  This value must either be a variable or contained in quotes.
:Param string/keyName The name of the key that will hold the value.  This value must either be a variable or contained in quotes.
:Param int/keyValue The value that will be written to the given key.
:Param int/FileType One of the FileType (FT_) constants that identify the type of file and its location.  The currently supported file types for writing are as follows: FT_DEFAULT_JCF: The file Default.JCF.  The FileName parameter is ignored for this file type.  When writing to this file, the changes will always be written to either the copy of Default.JCF found in the user settings directory or one of the transient settings files for Default.JCF, depending on the value of the WriteDestination parameter.  The copy of Default.JCF found in the shared settings directory will never be modified. FT_CURRENT_JCF: Any domain-specific JCF file.  If not found, the application jcf file will be used. If the FileName parameter is not specified, the value returned by GetActiveConfiguration will be used.  When writing to this file, the changes will always be written to either the copy of the JCF file found in the user settings directory or one of the transient settings files for the JCF file, depending on the value of the WriteDestination parameter.  The copy of the JCF file found in the shared settings directory will never be modified. FT_JSI: A JSI file.  If the FileName parameter is not specified, the value returned by GetActiveConfiguration will be used.  The changes will always be written to the PersonalizedSettings subdirectory of the user settings directory. The file types FT_MODULE_INI, FT_SHARED_DEFAULT_JCF, and FT_SHARED_CURRENT_JCF are not supported by WriteSettingInteger.
:Optional
:Param int/WriteDestination One of the WriteDestination (wd) constants defined in HJConst.JSH.  The possible values are as follows: wdUser - indicates that the setting should be saved to the user settings file; wdSession - indicates that the setting should be saved to the transient session settings file; wdFocus - indicates that the setting should be saved to the transient focus settings file.  Note that this parameter is ignored if the FileType parameter is FT_JSI.  If this parameter is not specified the default value of wdUser will be used.
:Param string/FileName The name of file to write to.  This value must either be a variable or contained in quotes.  It is unnecessary to specify the full path of the file, only the file name need be specified, since the file used will always be located in either the user settings directory or the personalized settings directory.  The FileType parameter is used to determine in which directory the file will be placed.  If this parameter is not specified and a file name is required for the specified file type, the value returned by GetActiveConfiguration will be used.  It is not necessary to specify the file extension since the file extension that is appropriate for the specified file type will be added automatically.
