Where extra contextual information is required to report the change in context, relevant flags and strings are filled in with data. For example, navigating into a formfield, nData1 will be the type(see WT_CONSTANTS), nData2 will be the state, sDesc1 the prompt, sDesc2 the value, sDesc3 the positional information and sDesc4 the extra help information if available. For comments, sDesc1 is the author's name, sDesc2 the initials, sDesc3 the text of the actual comment. For footnotes or endnotes, sDesc1 is the reference id and sDesc2 the text of the note. For bookmarks and smart tags, sDesc1 is the name of the item. For revisions, nData1 is the type of revision, sDesc1 the author, sDesc2 the initials and sDesc3 the text. For shapes or objects, nData1 is a type specifier, nData2 a builtin shape type, sDesc1 the name of the object, sDesc2 the text, and sDesc3 the dimentions. The units of measure used for the dimentions are in the current desired units of measure as defined by the smmSetDesiredUnitsOfMeasure function. For selCtxPageSectionColumnBreaks, nData1=column number, nData2=number of text columns sDesc1=page n, sDesc2=sectiony , sDesc3=z text columns (text column count) sDesc4= column j (where j is the number of the text column) For other contextual information such as spelling and grammar, the relevant bit of the context flags will be set in the new and cleared in the old to indicate moving into an error, or vice versa when exiting. Table info should be gathered from the table specific events. See hjconsnt.jsh for the selCtx constant bit values.

:Script ToggleDefaultUserMode
:DisplayName Toggle Default User Mode
:Synopsis Toggles the Default User Mode on and off.
:Description This script toggles the Default User Mode, which is also called the Default Alternate User Directory Mode, on an off. If the currently active Alternate User Directory Mode is AlternateUserDirMode_Off, this script sets the active Alternate User Directory Mode to AlternateUserDirMode_Default. This has the same effect as activating the Default User Mode. Otherwise this script sets the active Alternate User Directory Mode to AlternateUserDirMode_Off. The Default User Mode causes user settings to be saved in a subdirectory of the temp directory. The contents of this directory are transient; that is the contents of this directory are deleted when the product, JAWS or MAGic, enters or exits the mode. This mode is used for diagnostic purposes to determine if problems may be the result of user settings. Since the directory is initially empty this essentially causes the product to use factory default settings.
