# HTML User Settings Functions

You can use Settings Center and Quick Settings to configure many JAWS
options for verbosity and behavior on web pages or other areas where the
virtual cursor is active. Alternatively, you can set some virtual cursor
options using scripts and functions listed in this category.

While using Settings Center or Quick Settings to change an option saves
the change to disk, not all of the scripts and functions in this
category will save the setting for the option.

For a complete listing of HTML User Settings scripts and functions, see
the topics in this category book of the Reference Guide.
