<h1>13.0 Windows Program Structure</h1>

<p>Most people who use the Windows operating system never really understand
what the word &quot;window&quot; actually means. Most users realize the
rectangular box that appears on the screen when a new application is opened is
a window. They probably think of the text area of their word processor as a
window as well.</p>

<p>In most applications, every dialog box, menu, button, edit field, list box,
etc. is actually a separate window with one or more identifiers that can be
used to refer to it. However, a programmer may choose to create controls, such
as entry fields, without making them actual windows. Programs like this are the
most difficult to make accessible because there's no simple way to identify and
speak the various controls.</p>

<p>In this chapter you will learn about Windows program structure and
hierarchy. You will learn about different types of windows and how they are
identified by the operating system. You will learn how to determine characteristics
that uniquely identify windows. You will also learn how to use JAWS to explore
the window structure of an application.</p>
