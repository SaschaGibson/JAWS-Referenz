# Split Braille Overview

JAWS 2024 introduces the ability to split a single-line Braille display
in half and use each half to show independent information. Depending on
the split mode, you can pan both halves in sync, or independently. It
all depends on the purpose of why you are splitting the display.

You choose a Split mode using the SetBrailleView dialog by pressing
**SHIFT1+Dos 1-2-7** on a Focus Braille display, or by pressing
**ALT+JAWSKey+v** from the QWERTY keyboard.

The Set View dialog contains the following modes:

- Buffered text: allows you to interact with a live document on one half
  of the display and a buffered snapshot of text from the same or
  another document on the other half. In this mode, you can pan
  independently on each half and easily copy text from the buffered text
  to the live document as well as perform several other actions. these
  will be discussed more in depth in the Reference Book category summary
  page on this topic.
- Annotations: allows you to read comments, footnotes, endnotes, and
  revision descriptions on one half while maintaining focus in the text
  on the other half.
- Attribute indicators: shows the attribute indicators on one half for
  the text on the other half and even shows rotating attributes for text
  that has multiple attributes.
- Speech history: shows normal Braille on one half and what is sent to
  the synthesizer on the other half.
- Translation Split: shows the same text in two different Braille grades
  or using different Braille languages and allows you to choose the
  translation grade level for the language in use as well as its correct
  computer Braille.
- JAWS cursor: text at the pc cursor on one half and independently at
  the JAWS cursor on the other half. While this has limitations due to
  the fact that the JAWS cursor is not available everywhere, it can be
  very useful where that cursor is available.
- Window Text: shows text at the cursor on one half, and text from an
  arbitrary window on the other. Like the JAWS cursor mode, this one has
  similar limitations but can be very useful where available.

For specific common applications, JAWS ships with some custom views. For
example, in Outlook, you can choose to have the inbox on one half and a
preview of messages on the other half so you can read messages without
leaving the inbox. In Excel, you can monitor cells on one half while
changing their values on the other half of the display, or change data
on one half while viewing their totals on the other half, etc.
