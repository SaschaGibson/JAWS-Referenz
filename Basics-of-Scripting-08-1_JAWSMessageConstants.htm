 <H1>8.1 JAWS Message Constants</H1>

<P>In prior versions of JAWS, you had to create all of your messages as constants.
  A constant is a mnemonic way of representing a group of hard-to-remember values.
  Some examples of message constants follow:</P>
<P class="Code">Const<br>
msgSettingSaved_S = "Setting Saved"<br>
msgNoFollowPC_L = "The Jaws cursor will not follow the PC Cursor"<br>
msgNoFollowPC_S = "Jaws will not follow PC"<br>
msgFollowPC_L = "The Jaws cursor will follow the PC Cursor"</P>
<P>You can find the above examples in the default.jsm message file located in
  your JAWS settings folder. Each message ends with either an &quot;S&quot; or
  &quot;L&quot;. Messages ending in &quot;S&quot; indicate the message is a short
  message. By default, JAWS speaks short messages when you use intermediate or
  advanced verbosity settings. The messages ending in &quot;L&quot; indicate long
  messages. JAWS speaks these messages when you use beginner verbosity setting.</P>
<P>If you needed to make changes in any of these message constants, you would have
  to make sure the quotation marks are in place after the modifications are complete.
  Failure to do so causes compilation errors when you try to compile any script
  file that includes the default.jsm message file. </P>
<P>Each time you wanted JAWS to speak multiple messages; you had to concatenate
  the messages together to produce one message. If you remember using hot key
  help in JAWS 3.7, the information spoken by JAWS was lengthy. The keystrokes
  spoken by JAWS were a series of message constants concatenated together to make
  the entire list of keystrokes. An example of string concatenation follows:</P>
<P>&quot;This is the first part of my message.&quot; + &quot; I am using concatenation
  to create a single message &quot; + &quot;out of 2 or 3 messages.&quot;</P>
<P>The result of concatenating the 3 strings of text follows:</P>
<P>&quot;This is the first part of my message. I am using concatenation to create
  a single message out of 2 or 3 messages.&quot;</P>
<P>When you use string concatenation to create a single message, you also have
  to remember to use proper spacing. Otherwise, the words of your message may
  run together to create an unintelligible message.</P>
