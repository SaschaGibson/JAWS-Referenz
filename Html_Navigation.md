# HTML Navigation Functions

Most of the functions in this category support quick key navigation on
web pages or other areas where the virtual cursor is active. But this
topic also includes functions that provide navigational ability when the
virtual cursor is active and are not for quick key navigation in
particular.

For a complete listing of HTML Navigation scripts and functions, see the
topics in this category book of the Reference Guide.
