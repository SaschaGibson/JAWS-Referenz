<h1>10.5 Chapter Exercises</h1>

<p>The following exercises give you practice creating scripts that pass
keystrokes, access menu options that do not have shortcut keys and type text
into the active document window. These chapter exercises do not walk you
through the steps needed to create the script. Instead, the goal of the script
is shown first, the script documentation second and the code of the script
third. If you need to review the steps used to create a script or add functions
to the script, refer to chapters 1 through 9 for information on the steps
needed to start the Script Manager and the use of the New Script dialog. </p>

<h2>Exercise 10.1: Creating a Pass-Through Script</h2>

<p>The objective of this exercise is to create a pass-through script that takes
an existing application keystroke and enhances its functionality. Within
Internet Explorer, you can press, <strong>ALT+HOME</strong>,
to move immediately to your home page. When you press this keystroke, Internet
Explorer does not indicate audibly that you are going back to your home page. </p>

<p>Create this script within the script file for Internet Explorer, Internet
Explorer.jss. . </p>

<p>Your script should begin by passing the <b>ALT+HOME</b> keystroke through to
Internet Explorer. Before the script completes, JAWS should speak an
informational message advising you that you are now going back to your home
page. </p>

<p>After you have compiled the script, you can test the script by going to a
Web page other than your home page and pressing <strong>ALT+HOME</strong>. After you hear JAWS speak the
informational message, your home page should begin loading into Internet
Explorer. If you find that your home page is loaded into Internet Explorer,
then you can confirm the action was successful. </p>

<h3>Script Documentation:</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Script Name: GoToHomePage</li>
 <li>Attach to Key: Checked</li>
 <li>Synopsis: Loads your home page.</li>
 <li>Description: Passes ALT+HOME to Internet Explorer to load your home page and announces it.</li>
 <li>Category: Keyboard</li>
 <li>Assign To: <strong>ALT+HOME</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>GoToHomePage Script:</h3>

<p class="Code">Script GoToHomePage () <br>
TypeKey ("ALT+HOME")<br>
SayFormattedMessage (OT_STATUS, "Go to home page.", cMsgSilent)<br>
EndScript </p>

<p class="Note"><b>NOTE:</b> You can add the messages JAWS speaks
to a JAWS header or message file and then include that file within the script
file for Internet Explorer. See 8.0 Creating and Speaking Messages for more
information on creating JAWS message files and adding messages to the file. </p>

<h2>Exercise 10.2: Typing Text with a Script</h2>

<p>The objective of this exercise is to create a script that types your e-mail
signature in any active application window. You can use this script in your
e-mail application, any text editor, or a word processor.</p>

<p>You can use a series of TypeString functions to type the text of your
signature. Between each call to the TypeString function, be sure to insert
calls to the EnterKey function. After you have typed all the necessary text for
your signature, JAWS should speak a message informing you the signature was
added. </p>
