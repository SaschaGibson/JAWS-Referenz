<h1>3.3 Performing Functions</h1>

<p>Unlike scripts, JAWS performs functions based on the name and location of
the function. Each time a function is called from within a script or another
function, JAWS searches the application-specific script file first. </p>

<p>If the function is contained within the application-specific script file,
then JAWS performs the function and no further processing is done. If JAWS does
not find the function in the application-specific file, then JAWS searches the
default file. </p>

<p>If JAWS finds the function in the default file, then JAWS performs the
function and no further processing is done. When JAWS does not find the
function in the default file, then JAWS searches the list of built-in
functions. If JAWS finds the function, then JAWS performs the function and no
further processing is done.</p>

<p>When JAWS does not find the function, then you will hear JAWS speak &quot;unknown
function call to&quot; followed by the name of the function. JAWS will then
spell the name of the function. This message tells you that the function JAWS
tried to call may have a name that is misspelled, the function was previously deleted
or has not been written. </p>

<p>An example of how JAWS processes functions follows:</p>

<p>You create a custom version of the SayHighlightedText
function in an application-specific script file. You created this custom
version of the SayHighlightedText function because processing
of highlighted text is handled differently in the application. The SayHighlightedText function also exists in the default
script file. JAWS performs the SayHighlightedText function
found in the application-specific script file rather than the SayHighlightedText function found in the default script file.</p>
