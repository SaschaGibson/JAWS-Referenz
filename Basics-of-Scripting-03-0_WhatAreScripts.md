# 3.0 What are Scripts?

You can think of a script as a mini computer program that contains
sequences of individual steps used to activate and control a wide
variety of computer processes. The action a script performs ranges from
tasks as simple as entering repetitive strings of data to many of the
standard routines your computer does on an ongoing basis as part of its
operation.

Scripts or combinations of scripts and functions control most JAWS
behavior. Scripts analyze what actions are taking place in an
application and determine how to handle the screen reading for you.\
Script files also contain functions. Like a script, a function is also a
sequence of statements that perform a given task. However, functions
differ from scripts in that you cannot activate them with a keystroke.

You create scripts and functions with the Script Manager. You use a
standard set of programming codes, formats, and rules to create your
scripts and functions. After you have written your script or function,
you compile your script or function into machine-readable language, so
that the computer can understand the instructions. Once you compile your
script or function, they are ready for your use.
