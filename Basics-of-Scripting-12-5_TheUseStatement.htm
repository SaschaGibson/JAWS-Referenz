<h1>12.5 The Use Statement</h1>

<p>In a previous chapter of this manual, you learned about the include
statement. You use this statement to &quot;include&quot; the contents of a JAWS
script header or message file within a JAWS script file. There is a second
statement you can add to your script file that allows you to use another type
of Script Manager file.</p>

<p>If you were to look at the default script file, you would find a number of
include statements for a variety of header and message files. Following these
include statements, you will find a series of &quot;use&quot; statements. These
&quot;use&quot; statements allow you to create a link between the binary
version of one script file with the binary of another. For example, you will
find the statement use &quot;Magic.jsb&quot; in the default script file. This
statement tells JAWS to create a link between the compiled version of the
default script file, Default.jsb, and the Magic.jsb binary file.</p>

<p>This link then allows the script developers at Freedom Scientific to call
functions from the Magic.jsb file just as if the functions had been created in
the default script file or were part of the built-in functions of JAWS.</p>

<p>The syntax of the use statement is identical to that of the include
statement. You begin by typing the word &quot;use&quot; followed by a space
then the name of the binary file you want to include. The name of the binary
file must include the extension of &quot;.jsb&quot; and be surrounded in
quotation marks. Some examples of use statements taken from the default script
file follow:</p>

<p class="Code">use "say.jsb"<br>
use "Braille.jsb"<br>
Use "Virtual.jsb"</p>
