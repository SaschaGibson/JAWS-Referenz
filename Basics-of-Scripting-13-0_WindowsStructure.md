# 13.0 Windows Program Structure

Most people who use the Windows operating system never really understand
what the word \"window\" actually means. Most users realize the
rectangular box that appears on the screen when a new application is
opened is a window. They probably think of the text area of their word
processor as a window as well.

In most applications, every dialog box, menu, button, edit field, list
box, etc. is actually a separate window with one or more identifiers
that can be used to refer to it. However, a programmer may choose to
create controls, such as entry fields, without making them actual
windows. Programs like this are the most difficult to make accessible
because there\'s no simple way to identify and speak the various
controls.

In this chapter you will learn about Windows program structure and
hierarchy. You will learn about different types of windows and how they
are identified by the operating system. You will learn how to determine
characteristics that uniquely identify windows. You will also learn how
to use JAWS to explore the window structure of an application.
