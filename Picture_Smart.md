# Picture Smart Functions

An Optical Character Recognition (OCR) function provides or returns
information about OCR activities specifically in JAWS. Picture Smart
scripts and functions take this one step further to provide information
about a graphic or a photograph. The feature was introduced early in
JAWS 2019. JAWS uses telemetry information to determine whether to speak
and display anything in Braille, for comparison purposes, and so on.

Some examples of Picture Smart scripts include:

- PictureSmartWithControl
- PictureSmartWithCamera

For a complete listing of Picture Smart scripts and functions, see the
topics in this category book of the Reference Guide.
