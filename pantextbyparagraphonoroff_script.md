# Script: PanTextByParagraphOnOrOff

## Description

When On, panning shows the entire paragraph on the Braille display, only
showing a blank space if a word does not fit or the paragraph ends. When
Off, panning moves by what JAWS determines to be a line, which means
that you could have large blank spaces after the text as there is
nothing more on the current line.
