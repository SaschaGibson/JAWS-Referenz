# Notification Manager

Starting in JAWS 2022, JAWS added a notification manager to handle
notifications from Windows and various applications. It collects a
history of these notifications, and you can view this history at any
time.

Additionally, you can use the manager to define rules for speech and
Braille behaviors for different notifications, and whether to show
specific notifications in the history list at all. This functionality
has been extended further in JAWS 2023 to include the ability to
customize the behavior of notifications through regular expressions.

The scripts and functions in this book of the Reference guide are
specifically for the JAWS Notification Manager and its UI. They do not
include all types of events and functions that pertain to notification.
Many of the Windows events related to alerts and notification call the
Notification Manager functions to handle the processing of notification
text.

For a complete listing of Notification Manager scripts and functions,
see the topics in this category book of the Reference Guide.
