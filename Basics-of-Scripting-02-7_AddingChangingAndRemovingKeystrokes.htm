 <H1>2.7 Adding, Changing, and Removing Keystrokes</H1>
 
<P>After you locate the desired script, you can use the Action menu to Add, Change, 
  or Remove the keystroke assigned to this script. Freedom Scientific does not 
  recommend changing keystroke assignments within key map files provided with 
  JAWS. You should give careful consideration to the keystroke assignment before 
  you change the keystroke. You should try to add a new keystroke instead of changing 
  an existing keystroke assignment. You can add a new keystroke from the Action 
  menu. When you add a keystroke, the Keyboard Manager does not replace the existing 
  keystroke assignment. Rather, the Keyboard Manager creates an additional keystroke 
  assignment for the same script. If more than one keystroke is assigned to a 
  script, the script is listed once for each keystroke in the key map file.</P>
<P>When you delete a keystroke assignment from the key map file, the Keyboard 
  Manager does not delete the associated script from the corresponding script 
  file. Only the keystroke assignment is deleted.</P>
<h2><a name="add"></a>Adding Keystrokes</h2>
<P>You can add a keystroke to the key map file in one of two ways. You can choose 
  Add Keystroke&#133; from the Action menu or press <b>CTRL+A</b> to display the 
  add Keystroke dialog.</P>
<P>When the Keyboard Manager displays the Add Keystroke dialog, the Assign To 
  edit box is active. This edit box behaves exactly as the edit box used in the 
  Find Keystroke dialog. Press the desired keystroke and the Keyboard Manager 
  interprets this as the new keystroke you want to add. If you press a keystroke 
  that is already in use, the Keyboard Manager displays a warning dialog box advising 
  you that the keystroke is already in use. The warning dialog box also displays 
  the key map file in which the keystroke is assigned. At this point, you should 
  choose cancel and try another keystroke. </P>
<P>After you have pressed the new keystroke, press <b>TAB</b> to move to the assign 
  Key To checkbox. The Keyboard Manager determines the label for this checkbox 
  based on the keyboard layout you are using. This check box is checked by default. 
  If you leave this checkbox checked, then the keystroke assignment is active 
  for the current keyboard layout only. If you want to allow the keystroke assignment 
  to be used within all keyboard layouts, then it is best to press <b>SPACEBAR</b> 
  to clear this checkbox.</P>
<P>For example, when you are using the desktop keyboard layout the Keyboard Manager 
  displays the label of Assign Key to DESKTOP Keys only. When you leave this checkbox 
  checked, the keystroke is only available when the desktop keyboard layout is 
  in use. When you assign a keystroke to a script using a keystroke combination 
  that uses a key from the number pad, then the new keystroke is only available 
  when the desktop keyboard layout is in use. Laptops typically do not have number 
  pads. If you change to the laptop keyboard layout, the keystroke is no longer 
  available. When you clear this checkbox, then the keystroke assignment is available 
  in all keyboard layouts. </P>
<P>This checkbox determines what is displayed in the Key Map Section column of 
  information shown in the right hand pane of the Keyboard Manager. </P>
<P>After you have determined the keyboard layout for which the keystroke will 
  be available, press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Ok button. When you press <b>SPACEBAR</b> 
  to activate the button, the Keyboard Manager displays the Confirm Add Keystroke 
  dialog. When you press <b>SPACEBAR</b> to activate the Yes button, the Keyboard 
  Manager adds your keystroke to the key map file. After the Keyboard Manager 
  adds the keystroke information to the current key map file, the right hand pane 
  of the manager is active.</P>
<P class="Note"><b>Note: </b>After you have added a keystroke, you do 
  not need to save the current key map file. The Keyboard Manager saves the file 
  after the new keystroke is written to the key map file.</P>
<h2>Changing Keystrokes</h2>
<P>As stated previously, you should use care when changing existing keystrokes. 
  The only exception to the rule of changing keystroke assignments involves scripts 
  that you have written. In this case, your scripts are not provided with JAWS 
  and changing the assigned keystroke has no impact on the operation of JAWS.</p>
<P>  To change a keystroke assignment, first locate the desired script. You can then 
  choose Change Keystroke&#133; from the Action menu or press <b>CTRL+H </b>to 
  display the Change Keystroke dialog. Like the add Keystroke dialog discussed above, the Assign To edit box is active when the Keyboard Manager displays the change 
  Keystroke dialog. Like the Assign To edit field in the Find Keystroke and Add 
  Keystroke dialogs, this edit box accepts any keystroke you press. So do not 
  try to use the say line command, or <b>INSERT+UP ARROW</b>, to reread the contents 
  of this field. JAWS interprets any keystroke you press as the keystroke you 
  want to add. When you press a keystroke that is already assigned, the Keyboard 
  Manager displays the Keystroke in the Use dialog. You can choose to add the 
  keystroke anyway, or press <b>SPACEBAR</b> to activate the Cancel button and 
  clear the dialog.</P>
<P>After you have pressed the desired keystroke, press <b>TAB</b> to move to the 
  Assign Key To checkbox. Again, the Keyboard Manager determines the label for 
  this checkbox based on the keyboard layout currently in use. If you leave this 
  checkbox checked, then the keystroke assignment is active for the current keyboard 
  layout only. If you want to allow the keystroke assignment to be used within 
  all keyboard layouts, then it is best to uncheck this checkbox.</P>
<P>When you press <b>TAB</b> from the Assign Key To checkbox, the OK button becomes 
  active. You can activate this button with <b>SPACEBAR</b>. The Keyboard Manager 
  displays the Confirm Change Keystroke dialog. The default button in this dialog 
  is the Yes button. Press <b>SPACEBAR</b> to activate the button and confirm 
  the keystroke change.</P>
<h2>Removing Keystrokes</h2>
<P>If you have previously added a new keystroke to a key map file, you can remove 
  that keystroke as well. To remove a keystroke, select the keystroke and choose 
  the Remove Keystroke option from the Action menu or press <b>DELETE</b>. </P>
<P>When you initiate the remove keystroke action, the Keyboard Manager displays 
  the Confirm Remove Keystroke dialog. The default button in this dialog is the 
  Yes button. If you want to remove the keystroke, press <b>SPACEBAR</b> to activate 
  the Yes button, and confirm the removal of the keystroke.</P>
<P><b>Important:</b> You only remove the keystroke assignment from the key map 
  file, not the attached script. </p>
  <P>If you are removing a keystroke assignment you have added previously, then the 
  entire entry is removed from the key map file. If the keystroke assignment you 
  are removing is an existing keystroke assignment that came with JAWS, then you 
  will see the word &quot;none&quot; placed in the keystroke column in the right 
  hand pane of the Keyboard Manager.</P>
