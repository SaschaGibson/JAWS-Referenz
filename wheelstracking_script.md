# Script: WheelsTracking

## Description

Press this keystroke to toggle between the two settings. This temporary
setting allows you to track focus, using line/sentence/paragraph and
dialog navigation, or track the Braille Cursor. When tracking the
Braille Cursor, the left wheel moves by lines, while the right wheel
moves left and right. Since the right wheel does not wrap, you can
realistically visualize the layout of your screen.
