 <H1>3.0 What are Scripts?</H1>
 
<P>You can think of a script as a mini computer program that contains sequences 
  of individual steps used to activate and control a wide variety of computer 
  processes. The action a script performs ranges from tasks as simple as entering 
  repetitive strings of data to many of the standard routines your computer does 
  on an ongoing basis as part of its operation. </P>
<P>Scripts or combinations of scripts and functions control most JAWS behavior. 
  Scripts analyze what actions are taking place in an application and determine 
  how to handle the screen reading for you.<br>
  Script files also contain functions. Like a script, a function is also a sequence 
  of statements that perform a given task. However, functions differ from scripts 
  in that you cannot activate them with a keystroke.</P>
<P>You create scripts and functions with the Script Manager. You use a standard 
  set of programming codes, formats, and rules to create your scripts and functions. 
  After you have written your script or function, you compile your script or function 
  into machine-readable language, so that the computer can understand the instructions. 
  Once you compile your script or function, they are ready for your use.</P>
