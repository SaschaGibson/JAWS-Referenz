 <H1>2.3 Keyboard Manager, Left Hand Pane</H1>
 
<P>The left hand pane of the Keyboard Manager contains an alphabetical list of 
  all the current application key map files plus the default key map file. You 
  can use your <b>UP</b> and <b>DOWN ARROW</b> keys to move through the list of 
  files. You can also type a letter to select the first file in the list that 
  begins with that letter. Each time you type the letter, the next file beginning 
  with that letter is selected. You can continue this process until no file names 
  match the letter you are typing. The Keyboard Manager displays the contents 
  of the currently selected file in the right hand pane of the manager. </P>
<P>When you find the desired key map file, press <b>TAB</b> to move to the right 
  hand pane and review the information contained within that file.</P>
