# Function: MuteSynthesizerToggle

## Description

If using a software synthesizer, it maybe a good idea to mute JAWS when
using applications such as VoiceChat programs. This will allow the sound
card to be available. Running the script once will cause JAWS to be
silenced. Running the script the second time will turn the speech back
on. You can use the \"Adjust JAWS Verbosity\" dialog to mute JAWS. Next
time you press the keystroke to open the dialog, it will unmute JAWS
without bringing up the dialog.
