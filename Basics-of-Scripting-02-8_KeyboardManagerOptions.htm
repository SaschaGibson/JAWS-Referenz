<h1>2.8 Keyboard Manager Options</h1>

<p>You can use the Options menu to change the way information in the right hand
pane of the Keyboard Manager is displayed. You can sort the information based
on a different column, filter out different types of keystrokes, turn off the
confirmation messages, and assign the <b>TAB</b>, <b>SHIFT+TAB</b>, <b>ENTER</b>,
and <b>ESC</b> keys to scripts.</p>

<p>When you access any of the items found within the Options menu, the Keyboard
Manager displays the Options multi-page dialog. The active page corresponds to
the option you selected. Press <b>CTRL+TAB</b> to move among the pages. The
five pages contained within the dialog going from left to right are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Key Filter</li>
<li>Messages</li>
<li>Sort</li>
<li>Hot Key</li>
<li>File Filter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Filter Options</h2>

<p>You can use the Key Filter page to determine what keystrokes are displayed
within the right hand pane of the Keyboard Manager. You can choose to display
all, active, or application keystrokes only. You can also choose to display
only those scripts that have keystrokes assigned, or those that do not. This
page contains two sets of radio buttons. You can use the first set of radio
buttons to filter keystroke information based on the actual keystroke. You can
use the second group of radio buttons to filter out information based on the
script to which the keystroke is assigned. The following sections discuss these
options.</p>

<h3>All Keystrokes</h3>

<p>Use this option when you want to display all keystrokes from both the
application and default key map files. When you choose this option, the
contents of the key map file name column will contain either the name of the
application-specific or default key map file name. This option allows you to
see all keystrokes available within a given application.</p>

<h3>Active Keystrokes</h3>

<p>Use this option when you want to display only active keystroke assignments
in both the application specific and the default key map files. If a keystroke
is assigned in both the application and default key map files, only the
application keystroke is active. JAWS always acts on the first keystroke it
finds and it looks in the application key map file first. </p>

<p>This setting filters out duplicate keystrokes in the default key map file.
For example, when you have a keystroke such as <b>CTRL+G</b> defined in both
the application-specific and default key map files, the Keyboard Manager
displays only the keystroke assignment in the application-specific file. For
more information on application-specific keystrokes versus default keystrokes,
see <a href="03-2_ProcessingKeystrokes.htm">3.2 Processing Keystrokes</a>.</p>

<h3>Application Keystrokes</h3>

<p>Use this option when you want to display only keystrokes contained within
the selected key map file. This is the default key filter option. For example,
when you open the Keyboard Manager from within Microsoft Word 2007, the
Keyboard Manager opens the Microsoft Word 2007.jkm key map file. This is the
key map file for Word. The Keyboard Manager displays only those keystrokes that
are specific to Microsoft Word in the right hand pane.</p>

<h3>All Scripts</h3>

<p>Use this option when you want to display all scripts contained within the
selected key map file. This is the default setting. This option lists all
scripts regardless of whether they have a keystroke assigned to them.</p>

<h3>Scripts Assigned to Keys</h3>

<p>Use this option when you want to display only scripts that are assigned to
keystrokes. This option keeps any scripts with the word &quot;none&quot; shown
in the keystroke column from being displayed. For example, when you are viewing
the default key map file and you have not installed a Braille display, choosing
this option keeps the keystrokes used in conjunction with a Braille display
from being displayed. Scripts without keystroke assignments are also not
displayed. </p>

<h2>Messages Options</h2>

<p>You can use the Messages page of the Options multipage dialog to turn
off the notification messages displayed each time you make a change to the
selected key map file. By default, the Keyboard Manager displays these messages
each time you add, change, or remove a keystroke from the selected key map
file. This page contains only a single checkbox. You can clear this check box
by pressing <b>SPACEBAR</b>.</p>

<h2>Sorting Options</h2>

<p>You can use the Sort page of the multi-page Options dialog to determine the
column for which information is to be sorted. By default, the Keyboard Manager
displays all keystroke information sorted by the script name.</p>

<p>This page contains a single group of radio buttons that you can use to change the
sort option. Use your arrow keys to select the column that you would like to
sort by.</p>

<h2>HotKey Options</h2>

<p>You can use the HotKey page of the Options
multipage dialog to assign the <b>TAB</b>, <b>SHIFT+TAB</b>, <b>ESC</b>, and <b>ENTER</b>
keys to scripts contained within the selected key map file. Each hot key has a
check box, that when checked, allows you to assign the key to a script. Once you
have assigned one of these hot keys to a script, the keystroke no longer
performs its normal function. For example, when you check the <b>TAB</b> check
box in the hot key page of the Options multipage dialog and assign it to a
script, you can no longer use the <b>TAB</b> key to move from control to
control within a dialog box. You should only use these keys as a last resort
when all options for key assignments have been exhausted. </p>

<p>To assign one of these hot keys to a script, you must first check the appropriate
check box for the desired key. Next, you can close the dialog by either
pressing <b>SPACEBAR</b> on the OK button or by pressing <b>ENTER</b> on the
check box for the desired key. After you have closed the Keyboard Manager
Options multi page dialog, select the script or scripts for which the hot key
will be assigned. Choose either the Add Keystroke or Change Keystroke item from
the Action menu. Press the hot key when prompted by the dialog. After you
confirm the modification to the selected key map file, your keystroke becomes
active.</p>

<h2>File Filter Options</h2>

<p>You can use the File Filter page of the Options multipage dialog to indicate
which set of key map files JAWS should display in the Keyboard Manager. This
page contains a single group of radio buttons that you can use to change the
file filter option. Use your arrow keys to select the type of key map files you
want to display in the Keyboard Manager. You can choose from active, user only
or shared files. The following sections discuss these options </p>

<h3>Active Files</h3>

<p>Use this option to display all key map files currently in
use. If both a shared and user version of the same key map file exist, only the
user-specific file is displayed. This is the default file filter option. </p>

<h3>User Files</h3>

<p>Use this option to display only those key map files that reside in the user
folder on your system. These keystrokes override those in the shared key map
files.</p>

<h3>Shared Files</h3>

<p>Use this option to display only those key map files that reside in the
shared folder on your system.</p>
