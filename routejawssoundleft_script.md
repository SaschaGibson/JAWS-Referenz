# Script: RouteJAWSSoundLeft

## Description

This adjusts sound balance in the following way: JAWS sound will be
routed to the left - it\'ll only be audible from your left speaker, and
the sound of all other apps will be routed to the right. Note: Hardware
constraints may make it impossible to do this fully. Some headphones -
especially those with a 3.5 mm jack - may be unable to send sound to one
speaker only. In that case, you\'ll hear diminished sound in one ear,
and full volume in the other.
