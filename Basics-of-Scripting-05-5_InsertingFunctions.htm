 <H1>5.5 Inserting Functions</H1>
 
<P>You can insert both built-in and user-defined functions into the body of your 
  scripts and functions. You can eliminate any spelling and syntax errors when 
  you use this method to add these functions. </P>
<h2>Activating the Insert Function Dialog</h2>
<P>You can choose the Insert Function option from the Script menu or press <b>CTRL+I 
  </b>to activate the Insert Function dialog.</P>
<P class="Note"><b>Note: </b>You cannot activate the Insert Function 
  dialog unless the insertion point is within the body of a script or function.</P>
<P>When you activate the Insert Function dialog, the Function Name edit box is 
  active. The dialog box also contains a Function Name list box, Description edit 
  box, Function Returns edit box, and a number of different command buttons.</P>
<h2>Selecting the Correct Function</h2>
<P>You can type the name of the function you want to add to your script in the 
  Function Name edit box. As you type the letters of the function name, JAWS moves 
  the highlight to the matching name in the Function Name list box. When a matching 
  function name is found, JAWS speaks the description of the function automatically.</P>
<P>If you have typed several letters in the Function Name edit box, but have not 
  quite found the correct function, you can press <b>TAB</b> to move to the Function 
  Name list box. This list box contains all built-in functions along with any 
  user-defined functions from both the default and application script files. You 
  can use your arrow keys to move up and down the list. You can also use first 
  letter navigation to move immediately to a function that begins with a specific 
  letter. For example typing <b>S</b> in this list box will move the highlight 
  to the first function that begins with the letter <b>S</b>.</P>
<P>As in the Function Name edit box, JAWS speaks the description automatically 
  as you move through this list. </P>
<h2>Reviewing the Function Description</h2>
<P>If you did not hear the entire description of the function, or would like to 
  review the description of the function, you can press <b>TAB</b> until you reach 
  the Description edit box. JAWS retrieves the description for functions built 
  into JAWS from the documentation file for built-in functions, Builtin.jsd. For 
  user-defined functions, JAWS retrieves the description from the appropriate 
  application specific documentation file. You can use your arrow keys along with 
  any of the other cursor navigation keys to read the information contained in 
  this edit box.</P>
<h2>Accepting the Function</h2>
<P>After you have chosen the desired function, you can activate the Next button 
  to continue inserting the function. You can activate this button by either pressing 
  <b>TAB</b> until you reach the button and then press <b>SPACEBAR</b> or press 
  <b>ENTER</b> while either the Function Name edit box or Function Name list box 
  is active. If you move to and activate the Finish button, then the function 
  is inserted directly into your script or function. However, you will not be 
  prompted for any parameters that the function may require.</P>
<h2>Adding Parameters</h2>
<P>After you activate the Next button, the Script Manager prompts you for any 
  parameters required by the function. The Parameter 1 edit box is active and 
  the Script Manager reads the description of the parameter automatically. Like 
  the description of the function, the Script Manager retrieves the parameter 
  description from the appropriate documentation file. </P>
<P>You can choose to type in the value of the parameter, an appropriate variable 
  type such as a string or integer, or insert a function whose return value will 
  act as the parameter. If you choose to insert a function in the Parameter edit 
  box, then you can activate the Insert Function button by pressing<b> ALT+I</b>. 
  This action displays a second Insert Function dialog. You can select the function 
  in the same manner as you did for the initial function.</P>
<P>You may find that some functions only require one parameter while others may 
  require more. You can add the subsequent parameters in the same manner as you 
  did the first. When you enter the last parameter, activate the Finish button 
  to complete the insertion of the function. You need only to press <b>ENTER</b> 
  from the last parameter edit box to activate this button. You can also press 
  <b>TAB</b> to move to the button followed by <b>SPACEBAR</b> to activate it. 
  In other words, the Insert Function dialog contains both Next and Finish buttons. 
  You use the Next button to add the necessary parameters to the function, and 
  you use the Finish button to complete the insertion of the function into your 
  script.</P>
