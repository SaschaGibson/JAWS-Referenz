# Script: NavRockersTracking

## Description

Press this keystroke to toggle between the two settings. This temporary
setting allows you to track focus, using line/sentence/paragraph and
dialog navigation, or track the Braille Cursor. When tracking the
Braille Cursor, the left nav rocker moves by lines, while the right nav
rocker moves left and right. Since the right nav rocker does not wrap,
you can realistically visualize the layout of your screen.
