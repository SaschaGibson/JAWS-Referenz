<h1>9.4 Adding multiple branches, the ElIf Statement</h1>

<p>You can add the ElIf statement to an If-Then-EndIf structure to provide a secondary way of formulating a
branch. You use the ElIf statement to check a second
condition when the condition in the preceding If statement is false. You can
use the ElIf statement as a replacement for the Else
key word. You can also add one or more ElIf
statements to your If statements. However, they must be added before the Else
key word. Each ElIf statement must include the Then
key word. An example of an ElIf statement follows:</p>

<p class="Code">ElIf iVerbosity == INTERMEDIATE Then</p>

<p>When the condition being evaluated in the ElIf
statement is found to be true, then JAWS performs all statements following the ElIf statement. If JAWS determines the condition in the ElIf statement is false, then JAWS will do one of the
following:</p>

<ul>
 <li>evaluate the next ElIf statement</li>
 <li>perform any statements following the Else key word</li>
 <li>continue processing the statements in your script that follow the EndIf key word</li>
</ul>

<p>The example shown in the previous section illustrated the use of the Else
key word to allow for both true and false branches when JAWS compared two
values. The following example illustrates the use of the ElIf
statement as a replacement for the Else key word</p>

<h2>Example 1: Using ElIf Instead of Else</h2>

<p class="Code">If iVerbosity == BEGINNER Then<br>
SayFormattedMessage (OT_STATUS, "Beginner verbosity is in use")<br>
ElIf iVerbosity != BEGINNER Then<br>
SayFormattedMessage (OT_STATUS, "Intermediate or advanced verbosity is in use")<br>
EndIf</p>

<p>In the above example, JAWS compares the value stored in iVerbosity
with the BEGINNER constant. When they are equal to each other, JAWS performs
the SayFormattedMessage function following the If statement and speaks &quot;Beginner
verbosity is in use.&quot; If JAWS determines the two values are not equal,
then JAWS performs the SayFormattedMessage function following the ElIf statement and speaks &quot;Intermediate or advanced
verbosity is in use.&quot;</p>

<p>Although the ElIf statement in the above If
statement structure takes the place of the Else key word, it does not allow for
separate messages to be spoken when intermediate or advanced verbosity is in
use. You may find situations where you need to perform a group of statements
when a variable could possibly contain three or more different values, such as
the verbosity setting in JAWS. Likewise, yu may want
to perform a group of statements when two values are equal to each other, a
second group of statements when one value is greater than the other and a third group of statements when one value is
less than the other. Thus you can determine if the values are equal, one is
greater than the other or one value is less than another. The following example
illustrates the use of ElIf statements within an
If-Then-EndIf statement structure: </p>

<h2>Example 2: Using the ElIf Key Word to Check for Different Conditions</h2>

<p class="Code">let A = 5<br>
let B = B + 1<br>
If A == B Then<br>
SayFormattedMessage (OT_MESSAGE, "The values of A and B are equal")<br>
ElIf A &gt; B Then<br>
SayFormattedMessage (OT_MESSAGE, "The value of A is greater than the value of B")<br>
ElIf A &lt; B Then<br>
SayFormattedMessage (OT_MESSAGE, "The value of A is less then the value of B")<br>
EndIf</p>

<p>In the above example, JAWS compares the values of A and B. If JAWS
determines the values are equal, then the If statement is true. JAWS performs
the SayFormattedMessage function following the If statement and speaks
&quot;The values of A and B are equal.&quot; If JAWS determines the values of A
and B are not equal, then the If statement is false. Since the values of A and
B are not equal, then JAWS must perform the ElIf
statement to determine if the value of A is greater than the value of B. If A
is greater than B, the ElIf statement is true. JAWS
performs the SayFormattedMessage function following the first ElIf statement and speaks &quot;The value of A is greater
than the value of B.&quot;</p>

<p>If the value of A is not greater than the value of B, then the ElIf statement is false. JAWS must then perform the next ElIf statement that determines if A is less than B. If A is
less than B, then the ElIf statement is true. JAWS
performs the SayFormattedMessage function following the ElIf
statement and speaks &quot;The value of A is less than the value of B.&quot;</p>
