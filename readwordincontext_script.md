# Script: ReadWordInContext

## Description

Sometimes, a word needs to be reviewed in the context of how it appears
in the document, in order to see if it is really misspelled, or is the
correct occurrence of the word you are searching for. Press this
keystroke in the Spell Check or Find dialog, or when doing a search and
replace for specific text or items. The JAWS Cursor is placed on the
line containing the word and you will hear the line spoken in the JAWS
Cursor voice. Simply turn on the JAWS Cursor to review the line of text
word by word, character by character, or read more text around the line.
