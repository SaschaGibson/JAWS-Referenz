<h1>Introduction</h1>
</div>

<p>When used with most popular applications, JAWS&reg; screen reading software
provides you with screen information for the application you are using. The
information that tells JAWS how to behave is contained within a set of
&#8220;default files.&#8221; These default files, created by Freedom
Scientific, are provided with JAWS. Unfortunately, not all applications are the
same. Therefore, information telling JAWS how to behave in these applications
is contained in a set of &#8220;application-specific files.&#8221; </p>

<p>Through the many options available in the JAWS application, changes and
adjustments can be easily made to all of the commonly used features, such as
Verbosity and Screen Echo. But despite this ability, you may find special
situations that require more advanced or specific instructions so that JAWS can
properly navigate and provide the correct screen information in the
application.</p>

<p>A script file contains a variety of scripts and functions. You can think of
scripts and functions as small computer programs. Each script or function
contains commands that tell JAWS how to navigate and what to speak under
different conditions. You can modify existing script files or you can write
entirely new commands to make most any application accessible with JAWS.
Moreover, you can create scripts that automate many of your daily tasks. In
short, your use of the scripting language is endless and is only limited by
your imagination and creativity.</p>

<p>JAWS is not the only product developed by Freedom Scientific that takes
advantage of the powerful scripting language. Both the MAGic&reg; screen
magnification application, through the use of the MAGic Pro Scripting
edition, and PAC Mate Omni&reg;
accessible Pocket PC device take advantage of the power and flexibility offered
by the scripting language. With the familiarity gained from writing JAWS
scripts, you will be able to easily apply your skills when generating scripts
that control magnification and speech functionality found in MAGic. </p>

<p>For those of you who ask, &quot;Do I need a programming background to write
scripts,&quot; the answer is that while a programming background is helpful, it
is not necessary. In fact, many script developers working for Freedom
Scientific are self-taught. It is for this reason alone that we have compiled
this step-by-step manual in hopes that you will get a good start toward
becoming a successful JAWS script developer. </p>
