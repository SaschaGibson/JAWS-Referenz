 <H1>12.1 Functions, An Overview</H1>
 
<P>Functions differ from scripts in three ways. Unlike scripts, functions are 
  not activated by a keystroke. Instead, they are called from a script or another 
  user-defined function. When you call a function, the function performs its designated 
  task and then returns control to the calling script or function.</P>
<P>Second, functions can accept parameters. A parameter is data the function uses 
  to complete its task. For example, if you want JAWS to speak a message, you 
  use the SayFormattedMessage function. In order for this function to perform 
  its task of speaking the desired message, you must provide the text of the message 
  along with the desired output type. JAWS then uses the text and desired output 
  type to determine if the message should be spoken and then speak it. Without 
  this information, JAWS cannot perform the task of the function. </P>
<P>Finally a function differs from a script in that it can also send a value back 
  to the calling script. This value is referred to the function's return or return 
  value. For example, the GetLine built-in function retrieves the line of text 
  found at the location of the active cursor. When it determines the correct text, 
  the function returns the text as a string that you can then store in a local 
  string variable.</P>
<P>You create functions to carry out repetitive tasks. Instead of placing the 
  same code in any number of different scripts, you can put the code in one function 
  and then call it from those scripts. This makes maintaining your scripts and 
  user-defined functions much easier. Suppose you create scripts and user-defined 
  functions for an application. Within the script file for that application, you 
  have placed the same code in several different scripts. Now suppose there is 
  a newer version of the application available. You discover that your scripts 
  no longer perform as expected and need to be updated due to the changes in the 
  application. </P>
<P>Since you placed the same code in several scripts, you must modify each of 
  them and then test those modifications. On the other hand, had you placed the 
  same code in a single user-defined function, then you would have only had to 
  modify and test one block of code.</P>
