# 2.3 Keyboard Manager, Left Hand Pane

The left hand pane of the Keyboard Manager contains an alphabetical list
of all the current application key map files plus the default key map
file. You can use your **UP** and **DOWN ARROW** keys to move through
the list of files. You can also type a letter to select the first file
in the list that begins with that letter. Each time you type the letter,
the next file beginning with that letter is selected. You can continue
this process until no file names match the letter you are typing. The
Keyboard Manager displays the contents of the currently selected file in
the right hand pane of the manager.

When you find the desired key map file, press **TAB** to move to the
right hand pane and review the information contained within that file.
