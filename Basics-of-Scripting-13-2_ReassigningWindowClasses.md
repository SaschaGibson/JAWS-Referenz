# 13.2 Reassigning Window Classes

There is a standard list of window classes used by most programmers
during the development of Windows based applications. The JAWS default
scripts contain the necessary logic to allow proper speaking of these
standard classes. However, application programmers do not always use
standard window classes during application development. Many times, a
programmer creates custom window classes that are non-standard. JAWS is
unable to recognize the custom class and speak the window correctly.

You use JAWS to equate the unknown class to a standard class to allow
JAWS to process the window correctly. This process is called reassigning
the window class. Once you have reassigned a custom window class, JAWS
is able to identify the window and speak it correctly. During window
reassignment, you may need to try more than one class to determine what
standard class works best.

To reassign a window class, you can use the JAWS, invisible or PC cursor
to locate the window. To reassign a window class, do the following:

1.  Move the JAWS, invisible or PC cursor to the window with the
    non-standard class.
2.  Press **INSERT+F2** to activate the Run JAWS Manager dialog.
3.  Press **W** to move to the Window Class Reassign list box item
    followed by **ENTER**.
4.  The Window Classes dialog opens with the New Class edit box being
    the active control. The non-standard window class is shown in this
    edit box.
5.  Press **TAB** to move to the Assign To list box. This list box
    contains all of the standard window classes JAWS recognizes.
6.  Use your arrow keys to move through the list. Select the window
    class you think best suits the non-standard window class.
7.  Press **TAB** to move to the Add Class button and press
    **SPACEBAR**. You can also press **ENTER** from the Assign To list
    box to activate the Add Class button.
8.  Press **SPACEBAR** to activate the Ok button to close the dialog.
    Focus returns to your application.
