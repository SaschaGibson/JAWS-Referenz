 <H1>5.4 Saving and Compiling Script Files</H1>
 
<P>You have two options when it comes time to save your script file. You can choose 
  to compile and save the file with one keystroke. You can also choose to save 
  the file without compiling. Both save options are described below.</P>
<h2>Saving and Compiling Script Files </h2>
<P>After you have created a new script or function, you can choose the Compile 
  option from the File menu or press <b>CTRL+S</b> to save and compile your script 
  file. This action causes the script compiler to examine each of the scripts 
  and functions contained in the script file. The compiler checks each statement 
  in those scripts and functions making sure the syntax is correct. </P>
<P>When the compiler finds an error, the compilation process is stopped and the 
  Compile Error message dialog is displayed. This dialog advises you what type 
  of error the compiler encountered with the Ok button being the active control. 
  To clear the dialog after you have reviewed the cause of the error, press <b>SPACEBAR</b> 
  to activate the Ok button or <b>ESCAPE</b> to close the dialog. </P>
<P>After you have cleared the dialog, the insertion point is placed in the line 
  containing the error. At this point, you should review the line making sure 
  the statement is correct. You may also find the line containing the insertion 
  point does not contain the error. Many times a previous statement with incorrect 
  syntax can cause an error in a line following it. In cases such as this, you 
  will need to review both the line containing the insertion point and any preceding 
  lines.</P>
<P>Although the compiler checks the syntax of script statements, it does not check 
  spelling or logic. As you add function calls to the body of the script, you 
  must make sure the name of the function is spelled correctly. Failure to spell 
  the names of your functions correctly will result in run-time errors. A run-time 
  error occurs when you begin testing your script and a problem occurs during 
  the execution of the script.</P>
<P>When you hear &quot;unknown function call to Function ABC&quot; where ABC represents 
  the name of a user-defined or built-in function, you can be assured you have 
  a run-time error. You should go back to your script file and make sure all function 
  names are spelled correctly.</P>
<h2>Saving Script Files Without Compiling</h2>
<P>You may not want to compile your script file immediately. You may find you 
  need to save the file before you complete the script or function you are currently 
  writing. If you try to save the file using <b>CTRL+S</b>, the script file is 
  compiled and then saved. If your script is not complete, then the compiler could 
  encounter errors causing the file not to be saved.</P>
<P>You can select the Save Without Compiling option from the File menu or press 
  <b>CTRL+W</b>. When you choose this option, the script file is not compiled 
  before it is saved. Instead, the file is saved much like you would save a document 
  in a word processor or text editor. You can then come back to the file at a 
  later date and continue working on the script or function.</P>
