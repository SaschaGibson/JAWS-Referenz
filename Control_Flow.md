# Control Flow

The Freedom Scientific Scripting language allows for sequential and
decision-making control flow processing. when a script or function
performs statements step by step regardless of any situations that may
arise during the execution of the script or function, it is called
sequential flow control. If you create statements that perform an
evaluation, it is called branching, conditional, or decision-making.

For details on working with evaluation and looping statement structures,
see:

  Structures](Control_Flow/Conditional_Statement_Structures.html),
