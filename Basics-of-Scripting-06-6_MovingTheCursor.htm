 <H1>6.6 Moving the Cursor</H1>
 
<P>After you have activated, saved, and moved the JAWS or invisible cursor to 
  the active application window, you can move the cursor. </P>
<P>Nearly all of the keyboard commands you use to move the various cursors within 
  JAWS have corresponding built-in functions. For example, pressing<b> DOWN ARROW</b> 
  to move the cursor to the next line has a comparable built-in function of NextLine. 
  Likewise, pressing <b>RIGHT ARROW</b> has a comparable built-in function of 
  NextCharacter.</P>
<P class="Note"><b>Note: </b>When you press<b> DOWN ARROW</b> to read 
  the next line, behind the scenes JAWS activates the SayNextLine script. The 
  SayNextLine script does more than just move the cursor down to the next line. 
  The script determines what type of window is active and then reads the information 
  accordingly.</P>
<h2>JAWSPageDown and JAWSPageUp </h2>
<P>The JAWSPageDown and JAWSPageUp built-in functions perform special versions 
  of their respective keyboard commands. You can use these functions when any 
  of the cursors are active. However, the outcome of the function is based on 
  the active cursor.</P>
<P>When the PC cursor is active, each function performs the standard <b>PAGE UP</b> 
  and <b>PAGE DOWN</b> commands for the application. For example, when you press 
  <b>PAGE DOWN</b> from within a word processor, the PC cursor is moved down a 
  screen of information. Likewise, when you press <b>PAGE UP</b> from within a 
  word processor, the PC cursor is moved up one screen of information.</P>

<h3>Example 1: Using the JAWSPageDown function with the PC cursor</h3>

<P class="Code">PCCursor (); activate the PC cursor<br>
SaveCursor (); save the location of the PC cursor<br>
JAWSPageDown (); performs a page down command using the PC cursor</P>
<P>In the above example, the PC cursor is activated and then saved before it is 
  moved. Next, the JAWSPageDown function moves the PC cursor down one screen of 
  information. </P>
<P>When the JAWS or Invisible cursor is active, the JAWSPageDown function moves 
  the cursor to the bottom of the active window based on the cursor restriction 
  setting. Likewise, the JAWSPageUp function moves the JAWS or Invisible cursor 
  to the top of the active window based on the restriction setting.</P>

<h3>Example 2: Using the JAWSPageDown function with the Invisible cursor</h3>

<P class="Code">InvisibleCursor (); activate the Invisible cursor<br>
SaveCursor (); save the location of the Invisible cursor<br>
RouteInvisibleToPC (); move the Invisible cursor to the location  of the PC cursor <br>
JAWSPageDown (); move the Invisible cursor to the bottom of the screen</P>
<P>In the above example, the Invisible cursor is activated and then saved. Next, 
  the RouteInvisibleToPC function routes the Invisible cursor to the location 
  of the PC cursor in the active window. Finally, the JAWSPageDown function moves 
  the Invisible cursor to the bottom of the active window.</P>
<P class="Note"><b>Note:</b> The JAWS restriction setting is set to application 
  by default. This setting keeps the JAWS and Invisible cursors within the boundaries 
  of the active application window. You can cycle through the various restriction 
  settings by pressing <b>INSERT+R</b>. See the JAWS help system for more information 
  on cursor restriction settings.</P>
<h2>JAWSEnd and JAWSHome</h2>
<P>The JAWSEnd and JAWSHome built-in functions perform special versions of their 
  respective keyboard commands. Like the JAWSPageDown and JAWSPageUp functions, 
  you can use these functions when the PC, JAWS, or Invisible cursor is active. 
  However, the outcome of each function is based on the active cursor.</p>
  <P>When the PC cursor is active, each function performs the standard <b>END</b> 
  and <b>HOME</b> commands for the application. For example, when you press <b>END</b> 
  from within a word processor, the PC cursor is moved to the end of the current 
  line. Likewise, when you press <b>HOME</b> from within a word processor, the 
  PC cursor is moved to the beginning of the current line.</P>

<h3>Example 3: Using the JAWSHome function with the PC cursor</h3>

<P class="Code">PCCursor (); activate the PC cursor<br>
SaveCursor (); save the location of the cursor<br>
JAWSPageDown (); move the PC cursor down one screen<br>
JAWSHome (); move the PC cursor to the beginning of the line</P>
<P>In the above example, the PC cursor is activated, saved, and moved down one 
  screen. The JAWSHome function then moves the cursor to the beginning of the 
  line. When you execute this block of code, the PC cursor is limited to the active 
  window.</P>
<P>When either the JAWS or Invisible cursor is active, the JAWSEnd function moves 
  the cursor to the last text character or graphic on the line within the active 
  window. Likewise, the JAWSHome function moves the cursor to the first text character 
  or graphic on the current line within the active window. The active window is 
  based on the cursor restriction setting.</P>

<h3>Example 4: Using the JAWSHome function with the Invisible cursor</h3>

<P class="Code">InvisibleCursor (); activate the Invisible cursor<br>
SaveCursor (); save the location of the invisible cursor<br>
RouteInvisibleToPC (); move the Invisible cursor to the location  of the PC cursor<br>
JAWSPageDown (); move the Invisible cursor to the bottom of the  screen<br>
JAWSHome (); move the Invisible cursor to the beginning of the  current line</P>
<P>In the above example, the Invisible cursor is activated, saved, moved to the 
  location of the PC cursor and moved to the bottom of the screen. Next, the JAWSHome 
  function moves the Invisible cursor to the beginning of the current line. By 
  moving the Invisible cursor to the beginning of the current line, you now have 
  a distinct starting point. You can then use a number of other built-in movement 
  functions to move the Invisible cursor across the line to read a specific piece 
  of information such as a line number.</P>
<h2>Next and Prior Cursor Movement</h2>
<P>You can also use built-in functions to move to the next or prior piece of information. 
  Many of these functions also have equivalent keyboard commands like the JAWSEnd, 
  JAWSHome, JAWSPageDown, and JAWSPageUp functions. </P>
<P>You can use these functions with any of the three cursors. However, the outcome 
  of the function is determined by the active cursor. For example, if you move 
  the JAWS cursor to the title bar of the active application, you can continually 
  press <b>INSERT+RIGHT ARROW</b> to move across the title bar a word or graphic 
  at a time. When you continually press the keystroke, the JAWS cursor does not 
  stop at the end of the line. Rather, it continues to move on to the next line 
  until you reach the bottom of the window. </P>
<P>On the other hand, you can only move the PC cursor within the document edit 
  area of a word processor when you continually press <b>INSERT+RIGHT ARROW</b>. 
  Once you reach the bottom of the document edit window, the PC cursor can move 
  no further.</P>
<P class="Note"><b>Note:</b> When you continually press <b>INSERT+RIGHT 
  ARROW</b>, JAWS activates the SayNextWord script. The script must determine 
  how to read the next word based on the active window. When you use any of the 
  built-in functions to move to the next item, the active cursor is only moved 
  to that item, but, does not speak it. 
<P>The following list of functions moves the active cursor 
  based on the name of the function. For example, the NextWord function moves 
  the active cursor to the next word. The NextSentence function moves the active 
  cursor to the next sentence and so on.</P>
<ul>
  <li>NextCharacter ()</li>
  <li>NextLine ()</li>
  <li>NextParagraph ()</li>
  <li>NextSentence ()</li>
  <li>NextWord ()</li>
  <li>PriorCharacter ()</li>
  <li>PriorLine ()</li>
  <li>PriorParagraph ()</li>
  <li>PriorSentence ()</li>
  <li>PriorWord ()</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example 5: Using the NextWord function</h3>

<P class="Code">InvisibleCursor (); activate the invisible cursor<br>
SaveCursor (); save the location of the Invisible cursor<br>
RouteInvisibleToPC (); move the invisible cursor to the location  of the PC cursor<br>
JAWSPageDown (); move the Invisible cursor to the bottom of the  screen<br>
JAWSHome (); move the Invisible cursor to the beginning of the  current line<br>
NextWord (); move the Invisible cursor to the next word or graphic</P>
<P>In the above example, the Invisible cursor is activated, saved, and then routed 
  to the location of the PC cursor. Next, the invisible cursor is moved to the 
  bottom of the screen and then to the beginning of the current line. The NextWord 
  function then moves the Invisible cursor to the next word or graphic on that 
  line.</P>
