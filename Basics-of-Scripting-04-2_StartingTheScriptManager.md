# 4.2 Starting the Script Manager

The Script Manager presents a different set of starting options
depending on whether you are running an application when you start the
Script Manager or just running JAWS. When running an application:

1.  Press **INSERT+F2** to open the Run JAWS Manager dialog
2.  Press **S** followed by **ENTER**.

When you start the Script Manager from within an application, the Script
Manager automatically opens the script file for that application. If no
file exists, the Script Manager creates the script file. When running
the script manager from within the JAWS window:

1.  Press **ALT+U** to open the Utilities Menu.
2.  Press **S**.

> OR

1.  Press **INSERT+F2** to open the Run JAWS managers dialog.
2.  Press **S** followed by **ENTER**.

When you start the Script Manager from the Utilities menu, the Script
Manager opens the default script file. When you press **INSERT+F2**
followed by **S** and **ENTER**, then the Script Manager opens the jaws
window.jss script file. While the Script Manager is open, you can press
**INSERT+T** and JAWS will announce the script file that is currently
open.

**Note:** You cannot have more than one instance of the Script Manager
opened at a time. However, you can open multiple files within the Script
Manager. Press **CTRL+TAB** to cycle between open files in the Script
Manager.
