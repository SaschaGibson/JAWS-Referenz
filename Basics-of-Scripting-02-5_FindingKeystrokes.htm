 <H1>2.5 Finding Keystrokes</H1>
 
<P>You can use the Keyboard Manager to search for existing keystrokes. Before 
  you write a script, you can search the application key map file to determine 
  if the keystroke you have chosen for the new script is already assigned. If 
  the application for which you are customizing JAWS does not have a key map file, 
  then you can be sure the keystroke does not exist in the application key map 
  file. However, the keystroke may exist in the default file so it is a good idea 
  to check there as well.</P>
<P>The right hand pane of the manager must be active to search for a specific 
  keystroke in the current key map file. You can either choose Find Keystroke&#133; 
  in the Action menu or press <b>CTRL+F </b>to display the Find Keystroke dialog. 
  When the Keyboard Manager displays the Find Keystroke dialog, the Search for 
  Key edit box is active. Press the keystroke for which you are searching. JAWS 
  echoes the keystroke after you press it. Once you have entered the keystroke, 
  press <b>TAB</b> to move to the group of radio buttons that allows you to search 
  in the active or default key map file. If you do not change this option, the 
  Keyboard Manager carries out the search in the active file. Press <b>ENTER</b> 
  on the set of radio buttons or activate the Ok button by pressing <b>SPACEBAR</b> 
  to begin the search.</P>
<P>When the Keyboard Manager finds the keystroke, the script name associated with 
  the keystroke is selected. JAWS automatically speaks the highlighted information. 
  The Keyboard Manager displays the Keystroke Not Found dialog when the keystroke 
  is not found.</P>
