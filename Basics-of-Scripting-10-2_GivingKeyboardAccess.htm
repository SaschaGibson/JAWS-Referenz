<h1>10.2 Giving Keyboard Access</h1>

<p>When you encounter an application that does not use keyboard shortcuts,
there are several keystrokes needed to perform a specific menu item. With a
script you can accomplish the same thing with one keystroke. You can also add a
helpful message to the script that JAWS speaks after the keystrokes have been
processed. </p>

<p>Before you write this type of script, you must determine the keystrokes
required to move to the menu, select to the desired item and perform that item.
You should be certain that the keystrokes you pass in your script match those
steps exactly. For example, if you want to select a menu item that begins with <strong>S</strong> and has no access
key, you must make certain there are no other menu options starting with <strong>S</strong>. If there are
multiple items in the File beginning with <strong>S</strong>, you must use conditional statements to
make sure you are selecting the correct menu item. </p>

<h2>Moving to the Menu Bar</h2>

<p>The first action your script should perform is to move to the menu bar. You
can move to the menu bar in one of two ways:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Use the ActivateMenuBar function</li>
 <li>Use the TypeKey function</li>
</ul>

<p>The ActivateMenuBar function moves to or closes the Menu bar for the active
application. When you use this function, it acts as if you pressed <strong>ALT</strong> to move to the
menu bar or to close open menus. This function is useful in situations where
you only want to move to the menu bar or close menus that are already open.</p>

<p>You can use the TypeKey function to move to the menu bar as well. If you
only want to move to or close the menu bar, you should use the ActivateMenuBar
function. But if you want to move to and open a specific menu, then the TypeKey
function works best. The following examples illustrate the use of both
functions to move to the menu bar:</p>

<p class="Code">ActivateMenuBar ()<br>
TypeKey ("Alt")</p>

<h2>Checking the Menu Bar</h2>

<p>After you move to the menu bar, you should make sure the move was
successful. You don&#8217;t want to call the TypeKey function to pass a
keystroke to activate a menu item when your script did not move to the menu bar
successfully. To do so may produce unwanted results. You can use the
MenusActive function to determine the state of the menu bar. The function
returns a constant value of ACTIVE to indicate the move to the menu bar was
successful. When the menu bar is closed, the function returns the constant
value of inactive.</p>

<p>You can use this function in a conditional statement to determine if the
move to the menu bar was successful. The following code example moves to the menu
bar and verifies the move was successful:</p>

<h3>Example 1: Moving to the Menu Bar</h3>

<p class="Code">ActivateMenuBar (); move to the menu bar<br>
If MenusActive () Then<br>
SayFormattedMessage (OT_STATUS, "The move to the menu bar was successful")<br>
Else<br>
SayFormattedMessage (OT_ERROR, "The move to the menu bar was not successful")<br>
EndIf</p>

<p>The following code example moves to the menu bar, opens the File menu, makes
sure the move to the menu was successful then passes <b>S</b> through to the
application to activate the Save option. You could use this example in any
application that does not make use of the <b>CTRL+S</b> keystroke shortcut.</p>

<h3>Example 2: Opening and Selecting an Option in the File Menu</h3>

<p class="Code">; constant definitions for keystrokes<br>
; these should be added to a JAWS script header file<br>
Const<br>
KSFileMenu="F",<br>
KSSave="S"<br>
; script to save the current file<br>
Script SaveFile ()<br>
ActivateMenuBar ()<br>
If MenusActive () Then; determine if menu is open<br>
TypeKey (KSFileMenu); open the File menu<br>
TypeKey (KSSave); select and initiate the Save action <br>
Else<br>
SayFormattedMessage (OT_ERROR, "The File menu could not be opened.")<br>
EndIf<br>
EndScript</p>

<p>In the above example, the ActivateMenuBar function moves to the menu. The
MenusActive function determines the state of the menu bar. If the move to the
menu was successful, then JAWS performs the two TypeKey functions to open the
File menu and perform the Save option. If the move to the menu bar was not
successful, then JAWS speaks an appropriate error message. </p>
