<h1>6.3 JAWS Cursor</h1>

<p>The JAWS cursor acts just like the mouse pointer. It can go anywhere the
mouse pointer can go. In fact, the mouse pointer accompanies the JAWS cursor as
you move it around the screen. The JAWS cursor is not limited to any specific
boundaries and you can use the same navigation keystrokes as you can when the
PC cursor is active. </p>

<p>There are some things you should know before you start moving the JAWS
cursor. </p>

<p>First, since the JAWS cursor acts as the mouse pointer, you may find that
tool tips are opened as the JAWS cursor moves across certain areas of the
screen. </p>

<p>You may also find that other types of pop up information appear as the JAWS
cursor is moved. The Windows operating system automatically performs these
actions or events. You have no control over when these actions or events occur.
</p>

<p>You may find that you are using the JAWS cursor to activate a specific
button on the screen. You may not want to move the JAWS cursor from that location
to read another area of the screen. </p>

<p>Moving the JAWS cursor to read another area of the screen forces you to move
the JAWS cursor back to that button after your script finishes. Before you use
the JAWS cursor, you can determine if it is the best cursor for the job by
answering the following question:</p>

<p>Do you need to perform any mouse actions i.e. left click, on the item? </p>

<p>If you answered &quot;Yes&quot; to the question above, then you should use
the JAWS cursor. If you answered &quot;No&quot; to the question, then the JAWS
cursor is not the best cursor to use. </p>

<h2>Activating the JAWS Cursor</h2>

<p>You activate the JAWS cursor using the built-in function, JAWSCursor. This
function activates the JAWS cursor regardless of its location within your
system. When you use the JAWSCursor function, the JAWS cursor is activated just
as if you pressed <b>NUM PAD MINUS</b> from your keyboard.</p>
