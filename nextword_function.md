# Function: NextWord

## Description

This performs a special version of the CONTROL+RIGHT ARROW or Next Word
keyboard command. When the PC cursor is active, JAWS allows the
application to move the cursor. When other cursors are active, then JAWS
tries to move the cursor to the next word or graphic it finds to the
right of the cursor\'s current location. To speak the word at the new
cursor location, place a SayWord function after the NextWord function.
Note: Once the cursor has moved to the next word, it is not spoken.
