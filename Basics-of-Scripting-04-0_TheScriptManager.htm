<h1>4.0 The Script Manager</h1>

<p>The Script Manager provides you with all the tools you need to write,
modify, and use scripts. </p>

<p>The Script Manager is a full-featured text editor. In addition to the usual
features contained in most text editors, it has built in capabilities to help
you create scripts. You can insert functions into your new scripts, display
reference information about functions and scripts that have already been
written, check for errors that violate the rules of correct script writing, and
save and compile your script files. In addition to providing full scripting
capabilities for JAWS, the Script Manager can also be used to create scripts
for the MAGic Pro Scripting Edition. </p>

<p>The Script Manager provides hot keys you can use to read through the scripts
in your script file more efficiently. For example, a script file can contain
one or more scripts. You can use the function key <b>F2</b> to move forward
from script to script, or <b>SHIFT+F2</b> to move backward from script to
script. You can use the hot key combination, <b>CTRL+L</b>, to display a list
of all scripts in the current file in alphabetic order. </p>

<p>When you save your script file in the Script Manager with the keystroke, <b>CTRL+S</b>,
the Script Manager automatically performs an additional step not found in other
text editors and compiles your script file. Compiling a script converts the
file from text to machine-readable information. </p>

<p>The Script Manager saves the original text file with a .jss (JAWS Script
Source) file extension, and the compiled or binary version (machine-readable
language) is saved with a .jsb (JAWS Script Binary) file extension. This is why
it is always important to create and save your script files using the Script
Manager. If you edit and save your files using some other text editor such as Notepad,
they are not compiled when you save them, and JAWS will be unaware of the
changes you have made. </p>
