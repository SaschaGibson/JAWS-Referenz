# HTML Flexible Web Functions

Flexible Web is a UI that allows you to customize the web page
appearance with JAWS. The Flexible Web dialog allows you to set a
starting location for the virtual cursor on the page when the page first
loads, or to set rules that hide elements on the page. The functions in
this category allow you to test whether Flexible Web is enabled, to
enable or disable it, or to activate the Flexible web UI.

Once you are in the Flexible web dialog focused on the controls for
viewing the active rules, JAWS has functions to get information about
the active rules that are present.

For a complete listing of Flexible Web scripts and functions, see the
topics in this category book of the Reference Guide.
