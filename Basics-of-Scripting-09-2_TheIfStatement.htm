<h1>9.2 The If Statement</h1>

<p>You use the If statement structure in your scripts to evaluate a condition.
The process your script performs after the evaluation of the condition is based
on the outcome of that evaluation. The basic form of the If statement structure
includes the key words If, Then and EndIf. You must include each of these key
words in all If statements you use within your scripts. If you fail to include
any of these key words, then the script compiler generates a syntax error. The
basic structure of an If statement follows:</p>

<p class="Code">If condition to be evaluated Then<br>
statement or statements to be performed when the If statement is true<br>
EndIf</p>

<p>You always place the condition to be evaluated by JAWS between the If and
Then key words. JAWS evaluates this condition to determine what statements
should be performed next. When the condition is found to be true, then JAWS
performs all statements following the If statement. If the condition is
determined to be false, then JAWS skips the statements contained in the If statement
and begins performing any statements following the EndIf key word. In the basic
form of the If-Then-EndIf statement structure, JAWS only has one branch to
choose from. </p>

<p>When you construct If statements in your scripts, it is a good idea to
indent any statements JAWS performs when the preceding If statement is true.
Using indentation makes it easier to determine which statements are contained
within the If statement and which are not. You can press <b>TAB</b> in the
Script Manager to accomplish this task. This indents the statements inside the
If-Then-EndIf structure by approximately 4 spaces.</p>

<p>The following If statement compares the values of two variables. The code of
the example follows:</p>

<h2>Example 1: Using an If-Then-EndIF Statement</h2>

<p class="Code">var<br>
int iVerbosity<br>
let iVerbosity = GetVerbosity ()<br>
If iVerbosity == BEGINNER Then<br>
SayFormattedMessage (OT_STATUS, "beginner verbosity is in use")<br>
EndIf</p>

<p>In the above example, JAWS begins by retrieving the current verbosity
setting storing it in the variable, iVerbosity. JAWS
then performs the If statement comparing the value stored in iVerbosity to the verbosity setting value
represented by the constant, BEGINNER. JAWS performs the SayFormattedMessage function following the If
statement and speaks &quot;Beginner verbosity is in use&quot; when the values
are equal. However, when the values are not equal, then JAWS does not perform
the SayFormattedMessage function and no message is heard.</p>
