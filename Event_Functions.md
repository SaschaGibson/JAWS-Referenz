# Event Functions

The Freedom Scientific Scripting language utilizes many event functions
in the default script source file (.jss) as well as in many other script
source files. The list of functions in this Reference Guide comprises
all of the Event functions and their Helper functions. In the General
Scripting Concepts book of the FSDN, the major topic that explains these
types of functions is called [Events.](../Events.html)

The Events topic in the General Scripting Concepts book discusses each
category of event and its helper functions in summaries, where
applicable. Each summary includes some code samples. The categories of
scripts and functions include:\
